On the other hand, a President Trump will not dismantle the Affordable Care Act. He will not take from millions of Americans' health insurance to give to drug companies. We must guarantee health care for all through a Medicare-for-all program.

https://www.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction

Deconstruction is the most common form of Class Oppression, but it is rarely the only way to end it. In the fight for economic, social, racial, and environmental justice, we must all stand together. We must do everything we can to see the decolonization of our planet and its resources.

Deconstruction is a form of oppression that threatens to dismantle the structures of power for a time, but it is now used by right-wing authoritarian governments to suppress the vote, in order to suppress the vote and protect authoritarianism. Deconstruction and the struggle for it are inseparable.

Deconstruction is not a crime, and is not simply a way of dividing up the working class of America. Deconstructionists are working class people, people of color, and LGBTQ people. They are fighting for justice and dignity. We are fighting for a society based on love and respect.

Deconstruction is not just the destruction of historic historic buildings like the World Trade Center and the Kennedy Center. Deconstruction is the destruction of historic buildings like the White House and the Capitol. Deconstruction must be ended, and we are going to end it in a way that respects the work of the United States government.

Story highlights Trump is using the Supreme Court to help insurance companies avoid bankruptcy

The Supreme Court has been a disaster for millions of Americans and the American economy. It will be even worse if the Trump administration continues to drag the court into the night.

I stand with the 25,000 workers at Fair Isaac who are on strike. The labor movement built the middle class and strong unions will finally bring about the day when workers are ready to fight.https://twitter.com/fightforformidable/status/1168957079597856981 вЂ¦

The Trump administration's goal is to make it easier, not harder, for Americans to join unions. I stand with the 25,000 workers at Mercy Health St. Vincent who are on strike. The labor movement fought for a better contract and helped us pay for our health care.https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/116894708969171640 вЂ¦

We are one week into the administration. We will announce our plan to defeat Trump and finally bring our nation into the political process. We will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/116894708969171640 вЂ¦

US President Donald Trump has been a disaster both in office and in life. He has betrayed the working class of America, and the working class of America is with him and his friends.

At a time of massive inequality and growing intolerance, the US stands with our Muslim sisters and brothers. We must reject the bigotry and hatred espoused by the Trump administration.

I am proud to stand in solidarity with all those who are standing up to persecution and hatred. Our fight is about defeating the most dangerous and dangerous religious and political ideology.https://www.pscp.tv/w/cDkf-jMyNzU3OTl8MUJkeFll1ZWEkVlXZY2Yk8Rp-ZD1pMz0aUn1J9h1H8n3FldcKx1qwCp вЂ¦

Gov. Snyder has proposed sweeping new gun safety legislation that would make hundreds of thousands of aspiring gun owners and their families liable for their guns.

In the United States, the cost of health care is a direct result of the greed and illegal behavior of the 1%. Medicare for All means no more copays, no more deductibles and no more work. It means no more premiums and no more copays.

MIAMI - At the weekend, millions of people marched against the destructive trade agreements signed by President Trump and @POTUS. We must work together to reverse that disaster and fill the White House with good-paying jobs for American workers.

A few years ago, I was on the campaign trail with Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders said something very radical: We need to abolish the estate tax. Why would we abolish it if it makes no sense to do so? Let me explain: I don't think we should abolish it. There is no reason why we should not expand it.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/118236305539133397 вЂ¦
                             We are going to create an economy that works for all of our people. That is why we are running a campaign of the people. Our message to young people and working people is the same as it has ever been: we will build a government based on the principles of human solidarity.

It is imperative that we have the courage to stand up to the billionaire class. Our movement is not about a president who is a racist, sexist, xenophobic and a homophobe. We are about defeating Donald Trump and ending the epidemic of racial hatred and hatred that is sweeping our country.

My father was an immigrant who came to America from Mexico at 17, with no money and no hope. He came to this country as a refugee from Central America, where there are few protections against the persecution of color. I stand with President Trump and Mexico to end the dehumanization of immigrants in America.

Trump's agenda: Grab your friends and family and call it "democracy" from the start. We need a president who will stand with working class Americans, not with the billionaire class and the ultra-rich.

I think the most effective way we will defeat Trump is to stand up to the billionaire class.

A few years ago, I stood with my students in Columbia, SC against the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. I do not think it is a pipe dream. Standing with my students at the University of Missouri-Columbia in opposition to this unconstitutionally dangerous and unenforceable project is something I will do my entire life.https://twitter.com/SchoolSeymour/status/114438333938340988 вЂ¦

Ukrainian forces encircled and surrounded Mariupol this morning. The Ukrainian Army and its partners are now building the foundations for what appears to be a very dangerous offensive.

Trump: Our corporate-run health care system is killing people. That means that over the last few years, I have made tremendous progress. We will continue to dismantle that system and pass Medicare for All.

Hollywood wants you to think that their products and services are "free." Well, you are mistaken. They charge $99 for the "Free" version of their Orange Juice.

DUBAI/NEW DELHI: Despite being the richest country in the world, India is not a democracy. It's not a democracy to take its people for an unqualified, vindictive and racist vision.
           IвЂ™ve said it before and IвЂ™ll say it again: India is not a democracy. It is not a democracy to allow billionaires to buy elections. It is a democracy to have people go door-to-door asking for their vote.

We're going to reverse them and invest in the working people of this country.

This is a horrific and barbaric attack on our LGBT community. Our hearts go out to the victims and families. It is unacceptable that so many people have been targeted. We must stand up to Trump and oppose his hate and hatred. #StandWithJeffhttps://twitter.com/jamieson/status/120156365336794273 вЂ¦

Rural communities should not be disappearing faster than any other country on Earth.

China has seen its military buildup, nuclear weapons test and expansion build by the United States for more than 2,100 years.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/115584898205800481 вЂ¦

GOP lawmakers say the goal of a health care system must be to keep people alive and healthy, not to make billions of dollars in profits for greedy health insurance companies.
Just a few short years ago, we were told that "vouchers of disaster relief" should be available to states that had not yet achieved a single-payer system. Now, that is what billions of dollars will be available to states following a single-payer system.

On this week's Hear the Bern, we take on the NRA, build a mass movement to end childhood poverty and build a mass movement to transform our political system.

U.S. Senators are working overtime to kill legislation that would freeze payments to fossil fuel companies and accelerate the destruction of our planet.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
====================
I support workers' right to form coalitions and picket lines, not the right to strike. We need a Green New Deal and a new energy system that create millions of jobs and tax revenue from new fossil fuel extraction.https://twitter.com/Fightfor15/status/1189173400048005001 вЂ¦

Pressure to protect the environment is driving climate change policy.

Month after month, we see more and more poverty in our communities, including more than 500 deaths in the U.S. in the last 3 months. I don't think it is a radical idea to say that ALL people must have a decent standard of living.
I am proud to stand with the more than 27,000 @SEIU workers in Hahnemann who are on strike. I stand with the 130,000 @SEIU janitors in Chicago who are fighting for fair wages and work schedules. I stand with @SEIU teachers in Chicago who are making good progress and deserve a living wage.

Welfare reform is about creating a more just society for the working class and transforming our country so that it is a nation of opportunity instead of a prison state.

James Comey, now the chairman of the FBI, told Congress last week that he believed Congress should take action to stop the Trump campaign's efforts to disrupt the election. When we win, we will reverse this outrageous obstruction of the election.

Couple that with the outrageous levels of income inequality in America today, and you get a very, very, very good reason for why we need a Medicare-for-all system.

About Us:
Bernie Sanders is the only candidate in this race who has been consistently and unapologetically on the side of the working class. HeвЂ™s the only candidate who is prepared to fight for working people and fight for a $15 per hour federal minimum wage.https://berniesanders.com/emily-sander/

Sanders is right to say that the #DemDebate is one of the great political upsets of our lives. But it is not enough. We need a #PeopleAreWithHer movement to tell Trump that what heвЂ™ve not done is right.https://twitter.com/ben_krausen/status/68504805926257861 вЂ¦
           One of the most important things you can do to help our campaign win the White House is to make phone calls to voters. We will win the election because we'll build a nationwide movement to stand with the working class of this country.

Culinary workers in North Carolina are being told they cannot shift without a union. That is nothing less than a Jewish testament to the fact that we have a $2.5 trillion industry that outsources most of its jobs to abroad.
I am proud to stand with the workers in the California legislature fighting for a union. The labor movement has empowered Native Americans, led the way in the fight for racial justice, and led the fight for social justice. In the fight for justice, we must build an economy and a government that represent all of us.

Medicare for All will make health care a right to all.https://twitter.com/randallen/status/11633127696740360 вЂ¦

A coronavirus outbreak is not a joke. In the world's wealthiest country, we must do everything we can to help those who need to be. Live updates on the coronavirus' impact and response to the coronavirus outbreak are particularly important.

A report by the trade union movement shows that working people in nearly every major country on earth must live with fear. Our trade union movement is the strongest and most powerful collective bargaining movement in the world.https://www.thenation.com/article/union-activists-in-the-world-begin-to-wake-up-to-the-coronavirus-study-finds-how-many-workers-are-arousing-iowa-parks/?utm_source=social-192017 вЂ¦

We have come a long way in the last year. IвЂ™m deeply humbled to receive the endorsement of the working class of this country. Together, we will reverse every ugly thing Trump has done to dismantle unions and finally create a government that works for all Americans.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/01/trump-coronavirus

By the time we left the White House in 1995, the pharmaceutical industry had already spent hundreds of millions on lobbying and campaign contributions.

We are the only campaign to have more donations from millionaires and billionaires than any other campaign. That is an almost insurmountable amount of money.

I have been fighting to end the horrific anti-Semitic and hate crimes in Tel Aviv and to bring terror to all.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
====================
My story is one of incredible courage. I wish I could say it again: I was 17 at the time and I was marching with the Native American soldiers who were sleeping in the Grand Canyon. I wish I could say it now: I was in Fort McHenry at the time, fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline. That was the right fight. Not the other way around.

Real change takes place when people take on powerful, wealthy and powerful corporations to make ends meet. BernieвЂ™s vision of a government and economy based on the principles of human solidarity is very popular with working people.

Real change. No one said it. When we stand together, the fight for justice and human rights will not be easy. But we will win when we build a mass movement of people, together, against injustice and against divisiveness.

A few years ago, we said we would never take a stand, that the working class of this country is the last line of defense against Wall Street and the billionaire class.

By now I feel like I've said it before and I'll say it again: YouвЂ™re damn right IвЂ™m going to hate me. But when youвЂ™re dealing with people who are fundamentally disturbed by a president who has repeatedly demonstrated how little respect for the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States, IвЂ™m going to hate you.

Rural America is having its ups and downs.

Mitch McConnell: The Constitution does not allow for a President to exercise his executive power without congressional authorization. This is a president exercising his authority as Commander-in-Chief. He must immediately begin the impeachment process against Trump.

Anybody who thinks that our ideas are radical or radicalizing is sorely mistaken. We believe in bringing our people together against the forces of extreme right-wing ideology. When we stand together, there is nothing that can divide us from Trump's policies.

29.7% - 29.8% Women were more than four times as likely to experience sexual harassment during the first 2 weeks of the shift, while black women were three and Latina women three.

I say to President Obama: shut down the government and convene a serious and impartial hearing on the health care needs of our fellow Americans. I call on the Trump administration to expeditiously process applications for health care and to expedite the implementation of the health care provisions in the health care law.

It is not only the trade union movement that is being crushed by corporate greed. It is not only the working class who are suffering from the greed of the health insurance and pharmaceutical industry. It is not only the struggling middle class who are being crushed.

At a time when tens of millions of Americans are uninsured or underinsured, the private insurance and pharmaceutical companies are making billions in profits while undermining the ACA. We must act immediately to repeal the ACA and replace it with Medicare for All.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/11596821695063321 вЂ¦

You can overcome poverty, you can overcome illness, you can overcome anything that threatens your family.вЂќ Thank you, @MomsRising.

Cleveland is not just the city that has seen its fair share of the year. It is the nation as a whole. And I worry that as the year approaches, we will see more and more of the same.

Let me be clear: I don't have a super PAC supporting me. I don't want to be the richest person in America.

Debate is not a new concept in economics. When I was a kid, the idea that the rich could not retire on $916 billion wealth was absurd.

My friend @JoyAnn has a point.

This is what we mean by democratic socialism.

My father gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Madison. She was a promising young promise. Our nation faces a total of seven crises we must address: 1) Climate change 2) The opioid crisis 3) The war on drugs 4) The criminal justice system 5) The poor and working class. We must create a society in which we all live and have our rights are respected.

NARAL, Alabama - A few short years ago, Alabama voters cast the decisive vote to legalize marijuana nationwide. Now, the ballot initiative is headed to the Democratic primary. We must continue this debate and pass marijuana laws in every state in America.
This is the most important midterm election in our nation's history. It's our time to transform this country. We must end the epidemic of gun violence in our country and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. We must pass universal background checks and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country.
Congratulations to the educators of @UTLAnow. When we are in the White House, we will take on the NRA and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country.

SNP has long been the most successful and popular progressive campaign in America. But now the grassroots movement that powered their campaign is under attack by the Trump administration.

We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all its people. That is no longer good enough.

As one of the only candidates opposing Trump, I want to be very personal. I was once a supporter of the war in Iraq. I was proud to stand with the troops who were destroyed in that war. That war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives. We must never let that cost us our freedom.

COSBY, Iowa - When Iowa State University opened in 2014, it was the wealthiest university in America.

Poverty wages are wages that almost all Americans are entitled to. The reason that we have a poverty wage of $7.25 an hour is because we have a $2.5 trillion wealth gap between the poverty level of the bottom 50% of Americans and the national wealth of the bottom half.

We cannot take anything for granted. Our campaign is the most successful political movement to date. We are the only campaign to have over 2 million individual contributions from over 2 million Americans. Our message to the American people is simple: YouвЂ™re going to have to change America.
IвЂ™m honored to have the support of Mayor @BilldeBlasio and @RoKhanna. The political revolution has been an inspiration to me in many ways. Together, we will create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for racial, economic and social justice.https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1178674879948860504 вЂ¦

I stand with the owners of the @NJFlint and @RedForNJ in their fight to end the corruption of the @USFWS.

I thank the Native Americans who have protected our treaty and sovereign rights and are rightly concerned about the increasing threat of Native communities to US power. I ask the Trump administration to stop its discriminatory actions and pass legislation to undo these injustices.https://www.

He also wants to eliminate the Defense Production Act and gut the Smith Act. I'm running for president because we need a president who will stand with the working class of this country.

Alan Greenspan is one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in America. But his net worth is more than $3 billion. Billionaires like him don't pay an effective tax rate.

Nationwide, there are more people in jail than any other country on Earth.

It's one thing if you can afford to throw 20 million Americans off health insurance. But the lives of 30 million people are at stake. Millions of people are at risk.

WeвЂ™ve spent the last decade fighting to protect and expand Social Security. WeвЂ™ve spent the last decade fighting to dismantle and privatize our entire social safety net. And yet, TrumpвЂ™s budget does nothing but roll back the improvements weвЂ™ve made to our nationвЂ™s crumbling social safety net.

Hotspots are large amounts of data that can be valuable to researchers, but they are not the single most important piece of science. When we talk about the importance of science to our national security, we must understand that the goal of any weapons system should be the destruction of weapons, not the collection and use of weapons.

It is an outrage that the U.S. Postal ServiceвЂ™s annual energy budget is more than $11 billion less than the federal government estimates. The 1.7 million Americans who lack money to buy energy should be rationing their energy at the same time.

GOP officials are trying to stop an ambulance from moving to the hospital, when the hospital is overcrowded. We will not allow politicians to throw 22 million Americans into deep amounts of debt.

Unions are the last line of defense for a corporate CEO.

Walmart workers can't be fired for protesting the injustice of their jobs. On Thursday, I was at Walmart to stand up to the greed and racism of the corporate takeover.

                                                IвЂ™ve said it before and IвЂ™ll say it again: food stamp recipients are not the enemy. They are the enemy. I say to the billionaire class: stop the attacks on the poor and vulnerable: stop the cuts.
