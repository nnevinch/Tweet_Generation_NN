We're here together.pic.twitter.com/PZlceLUCq7

This is an excellent question, Eric! How do you define a crisis? - вЂњWhat's the political impact of a crisis?вЂќ - вЂњWhat measures do you take to prevent future crises?вЂќ - вЂњWhat are you concerned about, Mr. President? Massive financial instability and rising costs of healthcare. A healthy society is key to any solution.

Jason, I apologize for being late, but this is a very serious question: in what ways are you trying to build the capacity for a bigger federal government? The answer is absolutely no. We cannot create more of us by burning down the federal government, but we can do more by creating more of us. Including housing.

Jason, I know you want a bigger federal government, but you canвЂ™t put a price tag on disaster. You canвЂ™ve built a lot of infrastructure. But you canвЂ™t do more than pay for it. You canвЂ™ve got us to do things like this:

We are in a crisis bc we donвЂ™t have the luxury of war. WMDs have since been committed, and we can do far more. But we canвЂ™t put a price tag on disaster. To put it simply: we donвЂ™t have the luxury of war. We can do far more than pay for war.

2018: GOP's Biggest Shout-Out to Women in Politics - by @Sunrisemvmt. SheвЂ™s done it before. We can keep going.

Women like these have been treated so little they cannot leave home without their partners' permission.

Congress in New York State. We are in a crisis. We can no longer ignore the fact that New York has had more student-on-student sexual assault than any other state in the United States. We must: 1.

End War on Women 10. #Abolish Falsehood 11. #Abolish Progress 12. #Abolish Power 13. #Abolish Power 14. #Abolish Power 15. Valerie Plame is a powerful voice.

Just after midnight, @InsideCityHall went to the scene of a NOVA vehicle plowing through a group of students on the 4th floor of the Capitol. No one was injured. This is the scene of the investigation. (via @nytimes) pic.twitter.com/YmKUzrvkXn
Trump Jr. released a tape of the intercepted call. According to @nytimes, this is why a major law enforcement agency could not independently verify the contents of this conversation. (For context, this is why the Justice Department found no criminal wrongdoing in Trump Jr.'s meeting with the FSB.)https://nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/trump-and-cops-interview-lawyers-about-the-interview-lawyers-of-trump-children-trump-contacts-lawyers-about-the-lawyers-trump-contacts.html вЂ¦

Truly itвЂ™s the criticвЂ™s point of view. ItвЂ™s not how you feel or anything. ItвЂ™s how you feel. You choose to believe.
Or maybe thatвЂ™s the problem. I take no offense to those w/ criticism of my own views. The problem is the cynical and often false way the right treats those advocating for their interests: as though they are experts in some pointless arena, or that they are experts in some arcane or controversial area.https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1025173948785739504 вЂ¦

The real estate market is in such crisis right now bc we are seeing real estate values spike several times the Federal minimum wage. This is one of those spikes. I have spoken with several real estate reps & are told many are intimidated by the real estate market. I am scared for my family, friends, & neighbors.

I think that the best way to think of this is as a splinter group of people: a restaurant, a clothing store, a publishing house, a lab. Writers,itarians, artists, both - splinter groups. Intergenerational.
   We are the splinter group of journalists, activists, journalists + the news media. We are the splinter group of people who disagree, but who together are building a mass consciousness + mobilizing for change. We are the organizing mass, a team, a community, + a nation.

Power hasnвЂ™t always been a luxury. In fact, when we were a small, grassroots group, it was considered вЂњtoo muchвЂќ a luxury.

What kind of a world would we want to live in? Do we want to live in a society where the government remains in charge, the market is free, and everybody has a say in our decision-making?

Because of that, many services are treated differently from what they are in the US.

14 years ago today. I was a third generation NY14 kid growing up in a working class neighborhood of New York City. For the first time, I was elected to Congress.

One thing that will definitely help people is ensuring people know what they are talking about when they shop for a new pair of shoes. It's important to give people a bit of a break. We need to talk about this issue from a policy perspective. Straight up, if people are confused about what we are talking about, they are not going to be able to shop at all. That's why they go to the trouble of trying to find a shoe.

If you want to make a change in 10 years, start early, early, and with a purpose: - Start a union - Start a labor union - Start a national labor strike - Start a national healthcare strike - Start early, early, and with a purpose - Inspire & educate the public - Advance the public policy agenda
Before I knew Bernie, I was the only candidate in the primary to be openly critical of unions. It was an honor to have the support of the movement and start a movement with all our might: - @BrandNew535 - @BUHUTZ2 - @BrandNewDeal - @BrandNewCongress - @CynthiaNixon - @DeanElmore - @CynthiaNixonвЂ™s legacy is a blueprint for future boldleaders - The Democratic Party canвЂ™t do it alonehttps://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/87306955354700962 вЂ¦

McCain: Kavanaugh is a monster and must be dealt with as a severe reality

He: Is a monster. Doesn't he? Why must the millions of people he meets w/ torture testify in his defense? HeвЂ™s an anomaly. And the GOP knows that. TheyвЂ™re scared. TheyвЂ™ve been proven right. And they donвЂ™t care. They just want to protect their turf and intimidate Democrats

This is a big deal. If you visit our campaign office in Huntsvill, you will see that weвЂ™ve been working hard to establish ourselves as the party of the people. That is why IвЂ™m endorsing your campaign. We can win without you.https://twitter.com/justicedems/status/104822187612358976 вЂ¦

WeвЂ™ve got a movement of working class Americans who canвЂ™t wait to see our party transform. From the Bronx to Queens, working class Americans are the REAL heroes here.

It is time to end the War on Drugs. & We must demand immediate, full civil rights for all people.

The fact that those of us who grew up in a society where patriarchy still rules, or where elementary school was a place where girls could be seen as mere animals, are still taught that women are nothing to brag about is a testament to the fact that we are still taught that some folks are too scared to say whatвЂ™s going on to get us here.

This is another one of those trope tropes that gets reinforced subconsciously when we donвЂ™t talk about issues honestly. We are taught that power is a gift given to us by God, yet we are denied the ability to give back the gift. Jobs are the bread and butter of this trope, and for many people the amount of pay they get is nothing.

This is why Childish Gambino is a bonafide star. Working with his own music, he nails the message of this film with his own voice. ItвЂ™s not a вЂњduplicateвЂќ or вЂњcompeteвЂќ feel to it, but a deep, primal fear. When youвЂ™re fighting for вЂњhuman rights violations,вЂќ

I just got back from my daughter mowing the lawns. Tonight my staff was in the midst of cleaning up at our office complex. We had just begun to plant some trees for the upcoming planting season. Tonight we started a fire to cool things off. My staff and I are already using a purification system that stops the spread of fungal spores.

To those working in the food industry who asked what they could do about the вЂњdrastic driveвЂќ of restaurant workers and other workers, I say this: IвЂ™m proud of my work in restaurants.

SOUTH WESTWAY (CBS13) – A Bronx man has been arrested after he went on a shooting rampage inside a South Bronx restaurant. He was later found guilty of second-degree conspiracy to commit violence.

Story highlights A fierce rebuke from Rep. @RoKhanna

CNN anchor Jake Tapper pressed Crowley on his decision to light a gun on children in NYC, but Crowley refused to back down as he stated his position. He then asked Crowley about the Sandy Hook ruling, Crowley stated his position.

Crowley stated he does not believe children should be put in concentration camps where their lives are taken in order to massacre others. That is wrong. And is exactly what happened with #SandyHook. LetвЂ™s take a stand.https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/12/politics/nation/children-shaken-children-denials-video-shows-children-children-being-murdered-by-ice-ice-capitalism/index.html вЂ¦

If you think my stance on marijuana is вЂњmoderate,вЂќ then youвЂ™re wrong. The strongest arguments for and against marijuana are outright wrong. The right position is one that has been bipartisan for years. If I were Crowley, IвЂ™d be the one challenging marijuana legalization.https://twitter.com/johnreidman/status/108105748007929650 вЂ¦

Ricky Alexander/AFP/Getty Images For a young man who grew up in a working-class neighborhood of New York City, the Bronx and Brooklyn, this is a hard decision. But one thing is certain: we canвЂ™t allow our democracy to be taken for granted.

Thank you for coming around! It's been said many times that we need to rally + rally grassroots for change if we are going to improve the lives of working class Americans. Thank you for showing up. ItвЂ™s been said time and time again that the only way we can get change to people is by electing progressive activists to Congress. This morning we had the honor of rallying with @bobbyberk at BARN.

                    IвЂ™m not a lawyer. IвЂ™m not trying to dodge responsibility for actions IвЂ™ve taken. IвЂ™m not trying to make a legal defense fund for lobbyists. IвЂ™m not trying to bribe a judge. And I donвЂ™t take a dime from luxury real estate developers.

4.1 million people are undocumented in the US. Those who seek asylum must present a physical & mental health condition that is likely to result in their being denied the right to seek asylum.

Voter intimidation at polling locations is a problem.

The federal government has enacted a series of climate change plans over the last decade - including the #GreenNewDeal (still in full effect today) and #PhilandoCastile (still in full effect).

The Electoral College is a sham. It's a political machine that favors big money over people, unions over farmers, & marginalized communities over people over racialized bigotry. And the truth is, it hasn't changed much since the 1960s.

Congress and the GOP have been working to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (HC) for 14 years. They canвЂ™t repeal ACA without killing the law, which means cutting the insurance market in half. We need to replace ACA with something more.

GOP wants to ban teachers + parents + parents + parents from using the bathroom + changing facilities of children + parents. ThatвЂ™s wrong.

In this article, I discuss the continuing impact of homophobic language in US discourse. In this case, it was about transphobia. In this case, it was about racism. In this case, it was about white supremacy. And in this case, itвЂ™s all of them, together.

    I donвЂ™t believe that the GOP is better off w/o attaining the political consensus on climate change.

We asked questions about the agency, including - of course - immigration: - what should a work visa status be like - how we handle asylum seekers? - what kind of cages should be like - how do we secure the border?

Does that even begin to address the fact that these are veterans?
  There is a very clear line. When we speak out on behalf of war veterans, we are endorsing their use when they are the most directly impacted by the war. When we speak out on behalf of servicemembers who lost loved ones in action, we are endorsing their use. When we speak out on behalf of fighters dying in the line of duty, we are endorsing their use.

Political scientist Erica Werner asked 1,000 college political students to imagine themselves in a different world: one where we elected leaders, activists & journalists, instead of some corporate lobbyist group, as they are today. They did.

This stat is important - it tells you that campaigns have spent $3.4 million lobbying Congress in 2018. ItвЂ™s also important to follow the money, because thereвЂ™s a lot of money spent lobbying Congress from different sources. (In 2018, PACs spent $3.4 million lobbying % of Congress. That includes *regular funders who gave $5,000 to Dems,* who gave $5,000 to GOP,* and so on.)

In a time when the House is in chaos, Dems are working to keep the Senate in chaos as well. This is what happens when the two parties are in such close political blocs. Deeply disturbing levels of instability are occurring in both the House and Senate. ItвЂ™s really dangerous. The House is destabilizing both, and the Senate is destabilizing both. We HAVE to be extra vigilant.

The House is trying to get back control. A majority requires a majority. This is a crisis. We cannot afford to be in a crisis on the eve of a primary. We must organize. We must make change happen.https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/12/11/the-house-is-hurting-resisting-democrats-is-it-credibly-powerful/ вЂ¦

The Senate is only going to pass healthcare bills once, when itвЂ™s the last time. So what if we instead worked to work to build a Congressional majority that prioritized the needs of working class Americans while also ensuring healthcare was a top priority?

ItвЂ™s simply not true. Fossil fuel fossil fuel corporations are now worth more than US military spending (in billions). Fossil fuel corporations are now used to paying down their fossil fuel debt, but theyвЂ™re not вЂњpaying downвЂќ their fossil fuel debt now.

We need to have real conversations about the вЂњfringeвЂќ side of the coin. When pundits are so quick to make one of the most unsubstantiated claims about me, one of the most powerful tools they have at their disposal is the ability to sow doubt. ThatвЂ™s why it works.

This is a big deal: as a political movement, we must stand up to the Deep State, the powerful few who bow to it, and fight for their rights wherever it counts. That includes working with allies and allies abroad, too. Can include:

Calling out racism & big money in your party, as well. (In the US, the "colored" party is the same as the "red" party. Changing that is a separate issue, but it's a factor in future policy proposals)

Calling out bigotry, too. This is a big deal: as a political force, we must stand up for ALL people, groups, & beliefs. That includes LGBT+, people of color, immigrants, immigrants' rights advocates, & all people who have an issue w/ civil rights. (Also known as вЂњwhite supremacyвЂќ for those who seek to maintain white supremacy in the US)

Calling out big money, too. This is a big deal: as a political force contending with big money, we must always be open to exploring issues of economic dignity & justice. This is a big deal for people in multiple different ways.https://www.prince-newsweek.com/politics-how-many

The important thing about the issues of gun violence is that they donвЂ™t divide us. Some Americans are more likely to be violent because they donвЂ™t feel safe in their homes. And too often, too many Americans die as a result of gun violence.https://www.newyorker.com/news/local/jackson-county-police-officer-shot-and-allegedly-shot-in-jackson-village-i58610 вЂ¦
This is why I say that when people think of gun violence in America as вЂњfearless love,вЂќ they donвЂ™t mean it. Fear of retribution doesnвЂ™t mean it. Fear doesnвЂ™t mean it. Fear doesnвЂ™t mean it.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/us/america/police-shooting-bump-off-boulders-guns.html вЂ¦

This is what itвЂ™s like. People are scared. TheyвЂ™re trying to get to the polls. But theyвЂ™re not sure why.

So they assert their superiority,вЂќ thereby diminishing the need for intervention.

I could tell you were running out of water. At first I thought I was going to drown. But my gut bacteria told me to drink better. I drank the Kool Aid. @Pew found a way to keep our water to 1/2 cup. That's why I drink water. Also, one canвЂ™t help but feel ashamed for being a waitress. I know that. But thatвЂ™s just me.

The reason so many Trump voters avoid corporate Democrats, and Trump voters who voted for him last night: Because they donвЂ™t believe in a corporation, theyвЂ™re too scared to vote for a corporate Democrat.

There are several geographic limitations to this study. First, the sample was small. This is primarily a problem with sample sizes in US Census data, where large sample sizes are impossible to collect. Secondly, we did not include data from a foreign country. Third, the sample was small (<30 population) and the time frame of this study is less than 1 year.

About this mod Tweaked the script so that it doesnвЂ™t give the appearance of вЂњcompromiseвЂќ when it comes to gun violence. (Also, weapons of war shouldnвЂ™t be legal in the first place. вЂњProtective custodyвЂќ is one of the strictest rules in the United States. It applies even to guns, too.) This version also allows for more guns.

We are living in the Trump era of marginal-taxation, where marginal taxes are the tax on wealth - not income - for the very wealthy. Just look at Arizona. If you are an LLC you pay nothing in state income taxes - not even corporate $5.25 billion + a combined market value of $10.6 billion! Even more disturbing: this isnвЂ™t just an Arizona issue.https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-taxes-2018-las Vegas-cortez-taxes-2019/utm_source/20190120_19-08-gmx.html вЂ¦

WeвЂ™re challenging $3 million in bonds. Banks are required to issue bonds in cash. ThatвЂ™s what makes it so bad. All Federal debt is backed by $3 trillion.

W/ the War on Drugs, the stigma around substance abuse is much worse. Many donвЂ™t fight for the substance abuse that is so much of their lives. Yet we fight for the fact that it is happening. In fact, we are the ONLY party that explicitly advocates for legalization.https://twitter.com/ErikShulkin/status/1081598555546827889 вЂ¦
The GOPвЂ™s War on Drugs, which has killed over 1000 people and cost the US $7 TRILLION+ in healthcare costs, is a war on drugs that targets any substance use and/or mental illness that may limit oneвЂ™s ability to enjoy the benefits of marijuana. War on Drugs is a war on the very foundation we were supposed to build for peace, economic dignity, and human rights.https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1081312190564142680 вЂ¦

It's a very good thing - the DC Extended Universe is a strangely diverse universe, with cultures, races, religions, factions, and histories all at once. WeвЂ™re all playing teamsters (continually), but we also fight to protect the freedoms and rights of all people and viewpoints. That includes fighting for the spread of gender expression & culture, exploring the intersections of race, religion, sexuality, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism, nationalism.

Teamsters are the real deal + the real low. When you get to the primaries, the trope shifts to the sentimentality of what the establishment is doing. When theyвЂ™re down, they cry wolf, scam, or take their classism. But when theyвЂ™re up, they fire back. And they are AMAZING.https://twitter.com/BrynnHill1/status/106699690671340993 вЂ¦

Teamsters are the real deal. They are a powerful trope in the GOP, and one that gets used a LOT. They are used a LOT bc they are

Economists often talk about how wages are rising because of вЂњtoo manyвЂќ вЂќ corporations. But while corporations are paid a living wage, workers are not. So weвЂ™re paying ~$80k/year for the same services as Amazon.

Ricky Alexander is not a Republican, but he is a Democrat. He is running against a very dangerous Republican that is running against the very bedrock of our democracy: the rule of law. I am proud to endorse him.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1147704954382737800 вЂ¦
It's important to note that this isn't a critique of Trump. He is a mandate. He is a license for Republicans to abuse the power of the federal government, to abuse civil liberties, and do it in the most brutal and cruel ways possible. I support his candidacy.https://twitter.com/arthurdelaneyhp/status/114769774580983528 вЂ¦
The way we make promises feels awfully Game-of-Thrones-esque to me. But given that the President is basically the head of the DHS, IвЂ™m not sure what to make of his decision.

Fun fact: the people I speak with about immigrant issues most often are low income - people who can afford a TPS (though not always) - and are unlikely to have tax experience.

Story highlights Trump has yet to release his tax returns

According to @PolitiFact, Trump paid out almost $2 million in campaign contributions to political candidates, parties, and corporations this cycle. He hasn't released his returns - which are public record. This is a big deal. https://www.politifact.com/truth-about-donald-trump/statements/2018/nov/09/donald-trump-s-tax-return-republican-candidate-contribution-2017-tax-report-pay-out-almost-900-million-campaign-donations-2017-tax-report-is-true вЂ¦

If you take out the corporations most directly impacted by TrumpвЂ™s policies & apply that to small donors, itвЂ™s pretty bad. ItвЂ™s clear that Big Pharma & Wall Street funded his campaign and have been funding his operations, but not enough to stop his administration from drastically cutting benefits for working people.https://twitter.com/tytpolitics/status/953045607655771080 вЂ¦

Marijuana legalization is a winning strategy, but when voters legalize it, the problem doesnвЂ™t stop with marijuana - itвЂ™s growing all year round. We must move forward with a Federalist Society, and the Justice Dept, in a mass political shift, will establish a Federal Bureau of Marijuana Regulation.
                                                IвЂ™ve always appreciated folks pointing out that many aspects of policy are far from clear - but thatвЂ™s okay. When we come to it, the obvious questions are: - What does the policy mean for the public? - What does the policy mean for the marijuana economy?

Thank you for having me. This campaign is all about representation. The odds are against you. Our country is stacked against us. There are so many issues that are impossible to fix, but the GOP has enough. We need a real campaign. And that is what we need it right now.

In times like today, letвЂ™s be clear about one thing. We are living in the McCarthy Effect. If we allow the President to become the Supreme Leader of the United States, then we will trigger the worst-ever recession in American history.

When I was a kid, my family moved out of the Bronx when my dad died and I was 10 years old. My mom used to come home to hear my dad speak. It was scary. My dad was a powerful man, but he was also a terrible worker. So, I worked extra hard to keep my family in check. Today IвЂ™m selling Fossil Fuel and Fossil Fuel Fuel. ItвЂ™s a lifestyle. And working for the low cost of living.https://twitter.com/npr/status/95361739842633504 вЂ¦

It's no secret that our familyвЂ™s social security system is riddled with sexual predators. The answer is: no. ItвЂ™s called the "honorary system," basically. Honorable system is one in which a rich person is deemed worthy enough to merit the support of the entire society, even if that society doesnвЂ™t honor their merit. Honorable system is one in which a poor person is deemed unworthy enough to merit the financial support of the entire society, even if that society doesnвЂ™t honor their merit.

One of the most important ways a person can strengthen their sexuality is by becoming a Sister. You don't have to be a Good Girl - you can be What You're Doing, This, That, and Everything. You can be What You're Doing, You Can't Be What You Look Like, and Everything.

Sisterhood is a powerful movement. At its core, it's about acceptance of differences, acceptance of one another, acceptance of identity, acceptance of difference. You don't have to be Like Us - you can be Like Us. You can be Any of Us, at Any Point. You can be Us, or you can be Us.https://twitter.com/chrissilew/status/1230490533121353264 вЂ¦

There are a few things that make a successful sisterhood effort: - You don't have to be Like Us - You don't have Sexy Sisterhood, You Can't Be Like Us - You don't Have to Be Like Us, You Can be Us, Us, Us, Us, Us, Us, Us, Us. We are all of them. And we will fight for them all.https://twitter.com/myendisnow/status/12

To everyone in the US with a *dental plan* - letвЂ™s talk about it. As of right now, many people have dental coverage.
