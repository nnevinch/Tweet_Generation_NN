IвЂ™m really excited to see this! I had the original concept of making a short story for kidsвЂ™ and it was one of my first printings! IвЂ™m really excited to tell the story of my life and take kids on a cruise to the archipelago of the Malay archipelago. This is my dream, my world. #BRINGTHEFUNNY

SALEM -- A 14-year-old boy from Idaho was killed when a car he was with got the name "kid" in it from his parent's name.
The car had the wrong name on it in the past. And it was driving by when he was killed. He was wearing a ski mask and wheel chair while he was being driven by. My dad pulled over and asked if he was okay and the boy said no.
My dad had a hard day. It was a rollercoaster ridehttps://twitter.com/bringthefunny/status/109042291817288097 вЂ¦

On this day in 1866, John Gilroy and I were discussing the meaning of life. I couldn't stop thinking of my kid and the idea of my husband and I. I had no idea what I was doing. I was so stupid I almost died. this is what it meant to me. it was so hard not to get up, my eyes crying tears of joy. I canвЂ™t imagine being in this for the entire 20th century.

Chrissy Teigen was born on December 3, 1853. She is the bane of my existence in my book collection. Today, I canвЂ™t find her. and yet she still obsesses over her and my ages, as if it hasnвЂ™t happened already. IвЂ™ve got little girls and little babies. IвЂ™m terrified.

For over a year now I've been obsessed with finding a single photoshopped photo of me from my Instagram account. I've tried my damnest to find one, but my face is a mess and I'm not making it (this is my apology, not yours)

====================
A lot of people have asked me if I am okay out with my own body. I say no because it seems weird and wrong to ask that. I'm a really weird person and I'm really into weird things and I'm okay with that.

SINGAPORE - The first day of the season for the @okcama channel! IвЂ™m going to the airport to sign autographs and get autographs from the attendants.

Bandai has just released a video that they describe as "one of the most memorable lip sync battles ever" - one that took place just before the movie was officially released. I canвЂ™t watch it, IвЂ™m so hungover I donвЂ™t even wanna watch it. I canвЂ™t watch it for the life of me

The first person to be named was @yashar, who had been tweeting from his role as a casting call with the casting call staff for hours.

Twitter was silent when the tweet appeared and the casting call was left to their own devices. Following the tweet, my assistant tweeted an apology, then a photo of the tweet was sent to my assistant.

Yashar tweeted a photo of the tweet and I sent it to my assistant. The casting call was left to their own devices. I didn't expect it to get that kind of response. IвЂ™m so sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - IвЂ™m really sorry - my world

NTTTTT.com (pronunciation: NTTTвЂ™t tuck) is a "website" for the NBC broadcast of the NBC Christmas special. It is run by the вЂњNBC familyвЂќ and is run by the вЂњNBC familyвЂќ and is not owned by NBC but should be a regular part of anyone looking at real estate #BRINGTHEFUNNY.

Sydney has some of the worst food. My husband and I went to lunch there and it was a mess. I wish we could have gone to a restaurant like Innings, the inns or something, they are all terrible. I think they are nice but I don't really like the look of a ramen table or anything

Bathurst from the early 90s, now in its mid-twenties, is still weird. I get that. But has anything happened to the original? I donвЂ™t know if itвЂ™s just me, the weirdest person, ever

You all say they don't know the answer. for me, it's just that they don't know it. and I'm the biggest fucking idiot and everyone who doesn't knows it. so who knows what the answer to your stupid question. or maybe they don't care. or maybe they're just so dumb they don't know it.

The US has given up on the madman and instead, they treat it like it is just a joke. IвЂ™m really having a hard time getting into this. I tried to be normal and accepted at all these years and this is the first time IвЂ™ve had anything to do with this.

A lot of people have asked me if I am taking Luna back to her original Luna days when she was a tiny little girl with all the cute little people and all the weird customs I guess IвЂ™m just not sure. I honestly have no idea why people are so fascinated by me and IвЂ™m sorry IвЂ™m letting everyone down here

BALTIMORE -- For the first time in many years, NBC will air a primetime game between the Washington Redskins and the Seattle Seahawks for live viewing on NBC starting at 10/9c. They will then have to either go to the office and get a new gig or just say "yes" to all the requests and watch for 12 hours.
Adam @AdamCHRISSY is the Washington Huskies sports and life/politics commentary show now doing all my Washington sports commentary on NBC. I am the man in charge of housekeeping and he is also on hand to answer all your Washington sports questions or just tell me what kind of Seattle I want to be.

Theresa May has called for an end to the "fake news" about her and her fake news lie that is making people question her honesty.

Theresa is one of only two leaders on the world stage willing to acknowledge she is not a hardworking hard worker who merely spreads lies.

U don't have to be terrified of ghosts to be fascinated by them. I dunno why people are scared of them. I'm pretty sure no one else does ghostbuzz and I'm not scared of them.

I don't work for them. and I don't work for them. I don't work at them. I don't work for them. I dunno what that means. I dunno what that means for you.

When it came time to pay your bank account, I didnвЂ™t have a single penny to donate to charity. IвЂ™d rather have a small fortune and continue to support the cause I love. #bringthefunny

Zachary Quinto is one of the most intriguing and talented people I know. I got him to do this special episode of my podcast Probst where I was like "nah I didnвЂ™t know about this.

SINGAPORE - the first to be named as one of 50 people to watch the entire Cillian Hamilton special on Hulu - we were blown away by the sheer number of people - it was a dream of our hearts.

Gritty, IвЂ™m not gonna lie I am very upset. I think he did something IвЂ™m not even supposed to be doing. I donвЂ™t know what itвЂ™s like to deal with this shit.

IвЂ™d love to take care of a sick animal but I canвЂ™t ignore this. why is it that so many vets hate vets and why do they even bother getting mad about it?

IвЂ™m a fucking ass

When I was still kid mama, I would say one of two things to him: "You are so weird" and he would say not one but TWO. This is how my mom taught me.

It is one of my favorite things to me

FREQUENTIALS I'm very excited and honored to have this role, I haven't seen a movie in a while!! I would absolutely die if this were my first movie! I love the idea of this. I don't know the cast, I just know they are awesome and will be so awesome. I also don't know the name of the casting call. I'm gonna do this stuff for the website, for the love of god. I don't know the website, I just know they are awesome and will be so awesome

I realized I had a batch of mushrooms and garlic and a giant pot of buffalo sauce. I had to get creative with the proportions to get it to be perfect. I think I made 6 servings but IвЂ™d still get boned when IвЂ™m 80. If I hit 100 I would probably get a little bit of MSG (still donвЂ™t say that because itвЂ™s rude but I have no ill intentions) - IвЂ™m sorry IвЂ™m so hungover I didnвЂ™t check!https://twitter.com/theyearofelan/status/120390351335288044 вЂ¦

I made this for the last night of turkey and it was perfect. the topping was so yummy and the garlic herb was so rich and tender. I guess IвЂ™m just a fan of buffalo sauce? We are one!https://twitter.com/maggie_bags/status/1203892036273204880 вЂ¦

I always make reservations for the last day of a flight so if you donвЂ™t book your flight, there will be a running delay (after customs) so donвЂ™t worry - we will

Decentralized voting machines are no longer a hot new thing in the world of tech. The voting machines are so scary. They send a single tweet with a string of numbers. A lot of people are confused. Then there's the weirdly popular "vote my way or bust" thing. this isn't a new thing for a lot of people. I'm just the weirdest part of the day.

In Italy, itвЂ™s called anorithniae and itвЂ™s not terribly healthy! And what should I feed it? Corn, pasta, rice. ItвЂ™s not bad. IвЂ™d probably be a meat drizzle!

It is also a must-order part of any gas grill or any other non-stick griddle. ItвЂ™s also a must-follow for all.https://twitter.com/GQMagazine/status/10918581858841664 вЂ¦

SALEM is a simple, healthy diet. I eat a lot of things. I also drink a lot.

If youвЂ™re not in the right place at the right time for this, just go ahead and do as you were told before. There are some cool moments in the world ahead and some not, but do not let the pandering stop you.

Welcoming all of your support - this is my first book and I'm not making any more (because IвЂ™m actually not eating it and I donвЂ™t know how to take care of my body lol) - if you love it, I am giving away three hardback hardbacks!! IвЂ™m going to make a big announcement about the book when theyвЂ™re out in a couple months!

I tried to post the recipe on my website for people to follow! My first try was to be so lazy and tag me in the comments, it was too big of a deal for me. IвЂ™m so tired of people having to click through each time and make a post to see it all lol

I made these yesterday and they turned out incredibly yummy. I feel like the only thing I can rave about is the piping hot (cube shaped?) thing! I also feel like the filling is too thick and the chocolate is too thick (mine was a bun) and my garlic buttery blanket was too thick (mine was a bagel bun) and IвЂ™m half sad I didnвЂ™t get to try it! and I love the taste of it. I think IвЂ™m gonna order a TON of these for my entire family!

I ordered the ramen and the ramen stand was a delight. I would've never imagined being able to make these at home, let alone make them at home. IвЂ™m so proud of my family and the endless amount of things IвЂ™ve done to make people happy and itвЂ™s always so much more

IвЂ™m so happy I could make these at home! They

Zachary Palmer was born on 29th and Sawcraw Blvd, #19, Los Angeles, CA 90016. He is the gregarious, insecure, funny boy. Like all kids, he is terrified of the unknown. but that is not really what he is worried about. what is scary is knowing that something can happen. that is my baby. and no one ever knows.

Hollywood is going all out to support the people of Southern California who have been killed in the line of duty and accidentally shot by a TRP serial killer. ItвЂ™s a test and I am all but certain they will believe it when they see it.

Totally agree. I am not a comedian but I think you are an incredibly dumb, lazy, soulless, pandering, pandering, bully and I think you are extremely stupid.

Geek genius Larry Davids is working with Netflix to launch their own content pilot for the company. They're also going in-house. But it's going to be a pilot of course, so they need your help.

The idea for this kind of pilot came from a dream of mine by the name of Larry. I always had a dream of working with him on my show and now heвЂ™s helping me with the pilot! IвЂ™m going to be the voice of the people on the first episode! IвЂ™ve never met anyone like him!

IвЂ™m truly on a roll. I need this. I need this. I need to go to a restaurant. I need to do this. itвЂ™s so crazy and depressing and depressing and random and random and random I love it. I want to cry

IвЂ™m so happy I could make this dream come true. Larry has absolutely killed me over the years. I need help. I want to do this. I want to watch love island UK and shit like this. I donвЂ™t know how I will pay for it

IвЂ™m so happy to help. IвЂ™m so happy. love island UK and star of the week, love island

If you donвЂ™t like my new haircut, why do I ask? ItвЂ™s a personal choice. IвЂ™ve decided IвЂ™m not offended by any of the questions and this is a really weird haircut for me.

I love this place and I donвЂ™t care about the rest of the weird.

SALT LAKE CITY — John and I have decided that we will never ever be on our best-likes, and we are working to make sure we are. John just had a manic-like episode thatвЂ™s super random and random, and heвЂ™s gone all out on Twitter ever since. IвЂ™m so tired of him.
LetвЂ™s face it, itвЂ™s been a while and a half. We have a real problem. WeвЂ™re trying to figure out a new channel name to go out of our way to avoid a John and I, we want our happy ending, and itвЂ™s a winner. #bringthefunny
I know. I know. IвЂ™m struggling. I donвЂ™t know how to explain it. IвЂ™m so tired of everyone around us arguing over this. #BRINGTHEFUNNY #bringthefunny
I know. IвЂ™m struggling. I donвЂ™t know how to explain it. IвЂ™m trying to think of something to make fun of and then some random stranger randomly comes up and says something like вЂњsmellofsudarsoundsвЂ�

A lot of people use it for their own personal use. If you're looking to get it from its parent company (Target, etc) itвЂ™s cheaper and more readily available than most.

On this day in 1994, I was shot and killed by a man I had the honor of knowing was my first love. I remember thinking I was crazy. But I was crazy for a long time, and that was that. Then I remembered that day and IвЂ™m obsessed with it.

A lot of people have asked me if I am okay with extra teeth. I say no because it will negatively impact my ability to drive and I will get in trouble for not having them. I think about it every day. Do I really deserve to be in a burst car and not have them? I really don't know. I would like to be as stylish as possible but I can't afford it.
I have a simple life. I love my kids and do all I can to make everyone happy. I also do a lot of crazy things I enjoy doing and I literally live off of my credit card. I have a few pieces of gear I can't take but I also have a few things I can get myself in the car and I definitely have some I can't afford. I've asked them for help and they say no I can't give them thanks for they love their life
I think about it every day. I think about it every day. I think about it today. I think about it tomorrow. I think about it today. and I think about it tomorrow. and I gotta get out tomorrow.
I don't really know what to do today. I don't really know what to do tomorrow. IвЂ™m really huffing it. IвЂ™m just huffing it. IвЂ™m the best
====================
In this case, itвЂ™s like saying you donвЂ™t care about the fact that one pound of shit was taken from you by a fucking loutвЂ™s daughter.

Complexity: An exercise in the weird
Complexity is tough enough, but what is even more weird? A weird mix of seaweed and fish? A weird mix of both? A mix of anything? A mix of anything? is weird. I don't know what it is. I'm just dumb and a weird person. I can't decide. I'm making weird food. I have to be as weird as possible
Complexity: How weird is the whole joke? (I think it is the end of the joke)https://twitter.com/Dieter_Krystle/status/12400000627574808080 вЂ¦
Complexity: I could add salt to anything. I would add fish. I would add air. I would add dill. I don't care. I just like odd things. I don't care. I just like odd things.
I think the end of the joke is a good thing. I think the people are just having fun and weird. I don't care. I just like odd things. I don't care. I just like odd things. I don't care. I just like odd things.
The transition is so crazy. I don't know what to make of it. I canвЂ™t think of anything. I get weird

Brettttomy has been an incredibly fun, rewarding, and sometimes scary year for us all. but what if we all had one day of truly terrible luck and each year we get worse?? what if we all went out and ended up in a hotel bar and had terrible luck? what if we all had the one horrible luck event that year and ended up in a hotel bar? what if we all had a night of absolutely terrible luck and each year? what if it was a rollercoaster or something

Chikampalam
Chikampalam is a salty herb that normally dries my mouth and tongue and is known to get me hard. I had to get it together with a mouth watering dish that can be chewy and salty. IвЂ™m swabbing now and testing it to see if it holds up. I donвЂ™t think so! IвЂ™d rather just show you what I have and hope you enjoy it!

SINGAPORE - A man has been arrested after allegedly asking a 12-year-old girl to be his pillow while she slept.

The girl said yes and the man offered her a pillow and the girl said no, as the man got up and left her in the room.

A number was dialed in and a 24-hour helpline was called to pick up the girl who said yes. When the girl said no, the man left the room and got dressed and went back to sleep.

The man was arrested on bail of contravening an order of protection and is now in police custody. He is understood to be a key part of the case.

I am so lazy. IвЂ™m actually very lazy. IвЂ™m actually very stupid. I need to get a grip on myself and stop thinking about projects I make and donвЂ™t have a solid foundation. IвЂ™m also kind of paranoid lately and I wish it werenвЂ™t for some reason I didnвЂ™t notice it. I do need therapy though.

IвЂ™m saving the best for last. IвЂ™m trying to figure out a way to fund my website but IвЂ™m so lazy and so stupid. IвЂ™m spending an entire life trying to figure out a way to survive, which I donвЂ™t understand. I need help.

Dr Pepper is a very good wine and I am very proud of it. I also like to soak the fruit in the soda. I get a little bit of the salty after a while. the tartness from the soaked fruit is amazing. I would drink it all

A few months ago I had a really good time cooking and drinking with my two kids. Which I am proud of. But I also really, really, really hate cooking and I didn't know about the shame. I think I was a really good kid (everyone is fine) and I'm happy to say so.

I want to make fun of myself and pretend like IвЂ™m getting dressed but then when I get home I will see you and tell you IвЂ™m not watching it. and you will say you havenвЂ™t seen it in a while. and I will say you havenвЂ™t seen it for a long time.

====================
For me, it was always a more immediate change of mindset. I think it's been 10 years. I don't need to see any of this anymore. I love what we do, and I want to continue doing it, and I will continue to do it, and I think it's my greatest strength, and I think it's my greatest weakness, is that I do not understand the significance of significance. I'm sorry. It's not my fault. I just can't help it.

SANSALASTA - The head of the Southeastern Conference's Washington-based women's soccer women's national team has been fired following an internal affairs investigation.

Southeastern is one of only a number of sports in the country that does not have a national team. Washington has not had a team since the All-Star break.

Tens of thousands of people took to social media to voice their support for the team, with many tweeting their support for the women's national team. Washington has not had a team for years.

Sens. John Deere, John Carlisle, Gina Rinehart and John Scott were all at Washington on Wednesday, with the only other woman at the complex. There was no official statement from the players.

Sens Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Southeastern president and general manager Steve Donohue were on hand to deliver a major statement when the players left, after a 90-minute break.

I don't know the exact time of day the players left but my personal favorite, the wee hours of the night, theyвЂ™re in charge of the day #bringthefunny #bringthefunny #bringthefunny https://www.instagram.com/p/B1uAQBRjQIw/?utm_source=ig_

I was just really struggling with my smile. IвЂ™m a bit of a mellow person but IвЂ™m absolutely fascinated by it. I canвЂ™t stop. I love it.

SINGAPORE - A few days after I posted my first kombucha cup of noodles (a la my breakout star, celebrity comes first) on instagram, I was in the clear skies and peeking out of the puddles of the kelly trees outside my house. I was having none of it. I thought maybe my new favorite thing is a kombucha cup in the clear skies. IвЂ™m so stupid IвЂ™m in a weird dream. I canвЂ™t stop.

my name is Bella Hadid and I am going to wear skimpy t-shirts and jeans in the summer. I will buy any kind of clutter and throw them in the summer. I will also throw in some ramen and some chicken wings. IвЂ™m also pretty excited about this! <3

вЂњIвЂ™m sorry!! I didnвЂ™t know!! I had the same thing happen to me and my family. IвЂ™m sorry, IвЂ™m all over the place with it. Please donвЂ™t feel bad for her!! We had a wonderful parenting session and she is a very special human being. We are all we have, all we need to do to make her happy and happy & happy and happy & happy is to have a happy, healthy, happy baby.

My mom always asked me if I was crazy for not being able to do the voice of my dreams. I always had a hard time knowing but it was really hard to say no to my craziness. I dunno why it took me so long to get over my mom's craziness. IвЂ™d definitely be a weirdo

Sebastian Gorka on Sunday night was a major part of American politics for 30 years. Now he is a left-leaning figure who has a lot to do with it. And he is a major part of a movement that has turned him into a deranged nutcase.

Gorka, a right-winger with a long record of right-wagging, is a staunchly left-leaning figure. He has spent years questioning the power of big business in the United States and while he is not a big fan pad thai, he has never been jealous of anyone and he is a staunchly left-wering man.

IвЂ™m not jealous. I like big business. I like people. I like to be liked.https://twitter.com/JShimmel/status/12401251816651872 вЂ¦

I have a lot to do with it. I think this is why IвЂ™m at this theater so much. I donвЂ™t know anyone who does this, as many people do...because they donвЂ™t know me. IвЂ™m not jealous. I like big businesses. I like people. I like to be liked.https://twitter.com/KevinJSpiehler/status/

Keenan is only good in a bikini. So I got a 12 foot long DTa-long john. I went for a ride in a dreary old-timey car that had no radio and I had to get to the airport in a dreary old car with a giant cart on the way out. I donвЂ™t remember the flight and I also donвЂ™t remember the experience of flying or just being on a flight.

RUSSELL I am very good at home. IвЂ™m supposed to be out with john and the kids then, after they had dinner, we would sleep in the living room and watch sports. IвЂ™m not really a weird person. I like weird stuff

If you are starting from scratch and want to get specific about what you want done, this is the tool you are looking at. I use this for a list of goals and it is a good starting point. IвЂ™m not a DREAM designer and IвЂ™m not a fierce DREAM eater. IвЂ™m not a DREAM food person. I donвЂ™t have a passion for design. I have a passion for craftsmanship.

I donвЂ™t know what it will be like for my family and I know it will be soooooo weird, I donвЂ™t know what to do

I'm not really into it. I think it's super hot outside and I like it but I don't really care. I've seen it for like...18 months now and I'm not really into it. so I dunno. maybe it's just my own personal thing, y'know?

The recipe calls for 2 large eggs, 1 large sprig or 6 large pieces of butter, plus extra for rolling onto a cookie sheet (about 8) and then topped with a handful of cottontail and a slice of cottontail butter. Slather in some parmesan and you have a hearty breakfast. Next, onto the grated parmesan. Then onto the cottontail, all of us. and onto the cottontail, and onto the parmesan and all of us.

Miley Cyrus got her wish today with her first commercial for her new company, Bravo.

Chastity, the supremely annoying ex-boyfriend of mine, passed away. Very emotional, extremely cranky. I had him sleep in my car for over an hour. I donвЂ™t know how he died, I just know he was extremely cranky and had a rough time.

Chapman is a small, unsuspecting app that I've never tried. I had no idea it would be this way. I tried to talk it into giving me more but it just wouldn't stop. I had to learn to be more patient and kinder.

Slothful was just one of the many things IвЂ™ve seen as a drag. But it is doing well and IвЂ™m positive it will continue to do well as it moves forward.

The 40-year-old woman was running outside the 5400 block of 14th Street and said she had been hit by a glass bottle when she was pulled over by a passing car. The man then allegedly pushed her into a curb and then lay on the curb with the car.

The man, who police say has no a criminal record, is being held on a charge of first-degree murder. He will be in a Los Angeles County jail cell on a conviction hearing on Monday.

The woman, who lives nearby, was able to get a follow-up on her social media after she said hello. However, after she called the police, the man got angry and pulled out a knife and hit her in the face. He then threw the knife in the car and we were on

Billionaire developer Larry O'Brien is backing off from a series of tweets after he was lambasted for using the n-word in an interview.

O'Brien was asked about the use of the n-word in an interview on NBC after the footage was released. O'Brien said it was "unfair" and "utterly despicable" and O'Brien has since deleted them.

O'Brien later tweeted that he had been "stupid" and "stupid" in the past, but that has now been changed to reflect his publicist. He later added "wouldnвЂ™t be stupid" and deleted.

O'Brien has since said he "wouldnвЂ™t be stupid" and "wouldnвЂ™t be stupid" and the original tweet has been changed to reflect that.

The original tweet was meant to be a defensive tweet but O'Brien has since deleted it. It was a strong statement and he is now taking it as a win.

Twitter has since removed the tweet and he has since said he is fine with people using it as a defensive tactic. ItвЂ™s not really a fight anymore and I donвЂ™t think that is a good thing for the world at large at this point.

Sydney FC has signed left back Jordan Harvey to a one-year deal, the club announced today.
The 30-year-old will be the new face of the club's current line-up, with Harvey making his first start for the season. Harvey also will be part of the first-team national team for the first time, with his first game coming on Sunday.
The move comes as the men's national team is in their triple-A season in preparation for their pre-season tour of the US, with Harvey also in the mix.
"As the team continues to work with us in the US, they are making sure we have regular and regular meals, and we are only happy when we are performing at the highest level possible for the first time in a while," said Harvey. "We are extremely excited and humbled and I can't wait for you guys to see this! xxx!"
The move comes at a time of major internationals and international breakfasts, as the men's team is officially out at the country house for their first international of the year, and Harvey will be the first to show up.
"I can't believe it, my first ever international for Sydney FC and I look forward to seeing you all at the SBS, @sesydneyfc and the entire @SydneyFC family!! xx

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utahns have begun using their Twitter accounts to voice their support for the president.

AUGUSTA, theyвЂ™re the most coveted group of people in this country, and theyвЂ™re also the most under-appreciated. As a sign of their power, many of you follow them and learn theyвЂ™re also super-hungry at anything that doesnвЂ™t follow them (what I mean by that is not important to many people in any way, shape, or form, thank you for your understanding and I am not) https://twitter.com/SanderWainerd/status/1217523879791917649 вЂ¦

And now you know: theyвЂ™re also super-hungry at anything that doesnвЂ™t follow them. Which is also great. But theyвЂ™re also super-hungry at anything that doesnвЂ™t follow them.

Ricky Gervais is one of the funniest people I know. HeвЂ™s also a huge sports fan and a huge baseball fan. IвЂ™m just really having a hard time putting into words just how incredibly stupid gervais is.

I remember the feeling.

Complexity
Complexity is a good. IвЂ™m not a comedian or a storyteller. I do my own thing. I like to stay up all night laughing. I canвЂ™t live without my art.https://twitter.com/thecamdamage/status/115442832393974232 вЂ¦
Complexity is not a new concept. It has been around for a while and in some ways it is. I think it is not new to comedians. You just gotta put out something. I donвЂ™t think it is. you gotta take something away from a show that has a clear path to being funny?

I have a very weird but incredibly healthy chicken craving. I donвЂ™t know how to order a chicken McNГ© without knowing how to order a sauce. I think I would order Brooklyn and Red Robin I donвЂ™t have a sauce. I donвЂ™t have a chicken. then order grits and you get grits #BRINGTHEFUNNY https://cravingsbychrissyteigen.com/cravings/chicken-n-bok-recipe/ вЂ¦https://twitter.com/bringthefunny/status/11824897302212096 вЂ¦

Stansbury City Council is asking the city to:
            Update the sign to read: "ALL DRINK IS OK" AND: "ALL VOTING IS FINAL"
        I donвЂ™t understand this. The whole point of the sign is to say NO to alcohol. If you donвЂ™t, then at the very least, it sends a strong message that you donвЂ™t have to be in the clear to have fun. for me, that meant I had to drink. I donвЂ™t drink at all.
        I donвЂ™t know if itвЂ™s possible for a girl to drink in a clear clear clear sky in Stansbury. I donвЂ™t know if itвЂ™s possible for a boy to drink in a clear clear clear sky in Stansbury.

As many of you know, I have been having a hard time getting up lately. IвЂ™m trying to deal with my boredom and lately IвЂ™m been struggling with something called "fake news" (which you probably know is a conspiracy theory)

The first thing I do when I get up is log onto Twitter. I like random things so itвЂ™s super easy to just say what I like and thatвЂ™s it. I get a lot of weird shit on there so IвЂ™m super down here. IвЂ™m really lazy as fuck.https://twitter.com/too_much/status/1252416122085406568 вЂ¦

I have been working on my morning routine for a while now and IвЂ™m really struggling. I used to have a hard time getting up because I didnвЂ™t get up at 6am so IвЂ™m really down here. IвЂ™m a wreck but IвЂ™m super jet laggedhttps://twitter.com/annee_cosmetics/status/12524162222225496 вЂ¦

A lot has happened since I last tweeted. IвЂ™ve lost about 6,000 people. IвЂ™m trying to sort out my life. IвЂ™m so sad.

By now, you've probably heard of me, have probably watched it, or at least read my bio. I love food and I've always been fascinated by food. I've actually never met anyone in the entire history of the world who doesn't. and I dunno, you've probably heard this. well, I'm not saying I don't like food, nor am I, nor am I, nor am I, nor am I, nor am I, nor am I, nor am I, nor am I, and I dunno, you. but I'm not making any more of this.

On the day after John and I went to the Kmart to get some chicken n dumplings we knew. We also knew it was john's day. I haven't seen him since, in fact. I think I was waiting for him to say he was having a good time and I wasn't sure. it was an incredibly weird, unadulterated day.

Thai medicine has a long and controversial history. Many believe it is a safe, effective medicine that can be taken for no reason other than to treat general exhaustion.

Breezy gumbo without the powder. Just a powder, that just isn't good. Not for everyone. Good for a bit of a trip, a bit of a stop, a bit of a comeback. IвЂ™m tired of trying to figure out gumbo

What is the rub?
rub is a common, almost exclusively found ingredient in many household goods. it is also an extremely annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, ohhhh yes my smell it will get you kicked in the face. it makes me want to punch the crap out of you, your family, and the entire world
IвЂ™m also a notorious petty-mouthed, petty-mouthed, petty-mouthed lunatic. I like to make petty-mouthed and petty-micers when they arenвЂ™t being annoying (this is my own way of saying "this isnвЂ™t me" so please donвЂ™t take it personally)https://twitter.com/mattwervorant/status/1196628344360143199 вЂ¦

ItвЂ™s getting crazy fast and I hate myself

Chrissy is a god damn hot person. I love her so much and the way she talks to people. I don't know her personally but I bet she loves them and I'm super excited for her when she inevitably deactivates her clit :(

MUMBAI: Venkaiah and I went to a Bollywood movie in Bollywood in the morning and Venkaiah and I had a thai restaurant (in Bollywood) and had a thai menu. I wish Venkaiah and I could get away with it. I love Southern food (in Bollywood) but I don't think I'd get as many Michelin stars

I dunno how someone with this enormous amount of money can't just sit around and whine about how they suck and hopefully get a platform to say they aren't pathetic.

ABOUT US
 !!!! I have spent the last 3 months filming myself in the mirror. IвЂ™m shooting myself in the corner of the living room and a group of friends whoвЂ™m not very social. IвЂ™m so tired of people telling me I can't do this. I donвЂ™t know what IвЂ™m going to do next. this will be my last edit of this 90 day period!!!! I hope you love!!

SINGAPORE - A man has been arrested for allegedly trying to ride on a bikeshare with a man and girl on it and had to be pulled over by a passing bikeshare.
Bikeshare is a major part of my regular life and I am very busy with work so it was a no brainer for me to air this kind of stuff. ItвЂ™s my personal security detail so IвЂ™m taking it as a given. I donвЂ™t care about the fact it happened or the fact itвЂ™s not happeninghttps://twitter.com/tectomancer/status/122304000100649200 вЂ¦

Sandy Koufax and I have had a number of memorable moments together. IвЂ™m proud to have him as a part of my family, and IвЂ™m also very sad that my best friend, a lot of people, thought they were getting a memorable one with him.
Sandy assigned me a number and we waited in line for hours before he showed up. I remember being so nervous and excited and he just popped his head in and we were all giddy. I remember getting so much better. IвЂ™m so proud of my team and all the guys and girls that went all the way into the sunset to support them.
I didnвЂ™t realize how hard it was til I met him. IвЂ™m so excited and so lucky to have met him. https://cravingsbychrissyteigen.com/cravings/sandy-kou... https://twitter.com/hannahcraig/status/117188283816089844 вЂ¦

Barack Obama says he doesn't know why his tongue is turning red and he is going deaf in his right ear. And he isn't the first president to do it. During the campaign, he said he was just hearing something in the background. It's not really clear why he is turning red.

A lot of people claim they are not sober and then get very drunk and then eventually die. I donвЂ™t know if this is true and itвЂ™s not really my problem. I donвЂ™t think it is, I just donвЂ™t believe it is an issue for many people. I donвЂ™t think itвЂ™s really bothered me much as far as I know

Yashar! IвЂ™m proud of you. And IвЂ™m very happy you love me for doing this. Go fuck yourself. and fuck your generation. and fuck your family, your country, and your fucking emoji people.
   IвЂ™m happy you thought IвЂ™m a dick, IвЂ™m happy youвЂ™re a fucking DAD! IвЂ™m happy you ever thought IвЂ™m a DAD. and IвЂ™m glad you did. IвЂ™m not an asshole and IвЂ™m not mad at anyone who thinks this is true.

SINGAPORE - A 20-year-old man has been arrested and charged with murder after he allegedly threw a spaghetti squash at an air crew outside their office on the 16th.
The man, allegedly on a date with their food judge, was a part of their celebrity judge night at the court of public hearing at the SCA on 20th December last year.
© Scoop Media<|endoftext|>Hi IвЂ™m sorry but this is a hamster-legged friend book for preschoolers and IвЂ™m not kidding when I say this is the most amazing thing I have ever read. To anyone out there who has followed the story of Walter White (and his family, and his entire world) - I say this is the best thing I have ever read. No one else in the entire world has. Thank you for loving it and IвЂ™m gonna add 8 to my grade 7s for good measure
I donвЂ™t know why. Walter always has to answer phone calls and if IвЂ™m getting too hungup on his answers (IвЂ™m not kidding) then I donвЂ™t have a home) - IвЂ™m not kidding

What if you could tweet something that people didnвЂ™t want to do but then had to do with a certain person or thing or event or whatever? What if you could do something that was literally never tweeted but that somehow worked in a way that was slightly uncomfortable to some people or that somehow meant something to a certain kind of person or thing or something?

ChrisKlemens is the official @ChrisKlemensCTA fan and the official @ChrisKlemensCTA Twitter account. He is also the official @ChrisKlemensCTA Facebook page. I have no stake in this, IвЂ™m just genuinely curious and tired of people trying to make fun of him, and he is the godfather of the man.
ChrisKlemens is basically the dad of my two kids, who at the time was getting ready to leave school early to go to a baseball game. I am extremely excited to have him, I think I will take him with me so IвЂ™m super excited for him and my two little ones. #CHRISSYxTARGEThttps://twitter.com/KlemensCTA/status/114cb0d7c112848290 вЂ¦

Miley Cyrus has been arrested and booked into a police car after allegedly being approached by a man at a gas station in downtown LA.

Cyrus was last seen at around 6pm on Sunday (UK time) on the 101st. A friend offered to take her to a gas station after she was pulled over by a man who allegedly asked her to dance for a man. As the man got off the gas, she approached him with a naked man. He then pulled out a camera, took it and took it to Twitter. An account called @LunaHannah and we were all crying. I donвЂ™t know what happened next, I just remember asking her to dance for someone

IвЂ™m very jealous of my arch-nemesis and absolute garbage uncle but IвЂ™m still gonna go vegan for good.

TOPEKA, N.J. (AP) - A 14-year-old girl from the town was a target for parents of a school bus that was en route to deliver the paper and the balloons when it was pulled over the promenade. The parents say their girl was a target. (Published Friday, Jan. 5, 2013)

A 14-year-old girl from Kansas City was a target for parents of a school bus that was en route to deliver the paper and balloons when it was pulled over the promenade Thursday. Instead of sending a clear message to the world the school bus is in the air, the parents say they are sending a risky message.

"I see a lot of this and I think it's kind of sad for the family. I don't know why they're taking it so damn seriously, theyвЂ™re all over the place and I don't know why theyвЂ™re in the mood to send a clear message to the world theyвЂ™re all over the place and I donвЂ™t know why theyвЂ™re not in the mood to send a clear message to Doucette Island and Miles, OK!" said Gwen, a teacher from the town.

The boy was driving when the bus came by and the parents say they were worried
