In response to my proposal to improve the nationвЂ™s trade policy, the president sent a clear signal that heвЂ™ll overturn Citizens United if Congress doesnвЂ™t act immediately.

This is one of the best parts of our trip to Utah. I love the way the Smoked Beer Trail stretches across 2,500 acres from Golden, Utah to Zion, Utah. This is a trail that's been our country's bane for generations.pic.twitter.com/v6sRQ9bqz0

When I was a kid, everybody wanted to be a mom. But when I was a kid, nobody wanted to be a mom. I had a lot of issues with my family that had nothing to do with money or the effects of contraception on women's health. But when I was a kid, I got over them, and I got on the team. (That's why I ended up in the Senate, where I got my biggest applause during the @massdems convention last week.)

People are worried that the Trump administration is taking away women's health care and coverage. Well, they're worried that's the dream of a womanвЂ”and theyвЂ™re right. WomenвЂ™s health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights.https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/women-health-care-women-health-insurance-presidential-2020-russian-president-s-president-s-logans-women-virginia-virginia-46165785 вЂ¦

Veterans Affairs Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has been a tireless champion for our vets, but the American people want answers on whether Sebelius' administration has been ethicalвЂ”or if she'll continue to mislead the American people about her record of care for servicemembers.
               The Secretary of Defense is responsible for ensuring that our nationвЂ™s defense against foreign threats is kept secureвЂ”and that threats are taken seriously. Under Secretary SebeliusвЂ™s watch, thatвЂ™s been a record number of successful attacks on our diplomats and our military.
My Secretary of Defense would be someone with a deep knowledge of defense strategy and a deep commitment to national security. Under her watch, our military has been stretched to the breaking pointвЂ”and that means our national security is at risk.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/04/elizabeth-warren-undersecretary-office-2020-2020-04-elizabeth-warren-secretary-3264 вЂ¦

                 IвЂ™m tired of coronavirus survivors wondering how we will end this crisis. Here are just a few ways we can help. 1. Invest in medical care. Well-maintained coronavirus care homes and other critical infrastructure should be the center of our communities.2. Create and maintain strong, co-located community centers. Centers should be accessible to the public, and accessible for everyone to live in.

That's why I've got a plan for #UniversalChildCare and universal free public collegeвЂ”because that's how we'll level the playing field for AmericaвЂ™s working families.pic.twitter.com/v3TW9zv4bp

Where does this leave us? How can we root out the corruption in Washington? How can we build a grassroots movement to make our government work for the people?

====================
The whole process has been a charade from the first day. The GOP is now arguing that under the Constitution, Congress can never try to stop a presidentвЂ”because itвЂ™s a democracy. That's a lie, and it's worse than that. Our democracy is stronger when we have a chance to choose a president from among all of us.https://twitter.com/MarkFriederman/status/1230424493095793216 вЂ¦

Warren Buffett is now worth a little less than his father, and his inheritance is now worth less than his family history.

The federal government is bending over backwards to protect Big Banks and investors at the expense of everyone else. It's time to break the grip of lobbyists on Washington & give everyone a fighting chance at the big dollar bailout they desperately need.

Seth Meyers has been a powerful voice for working people in Washington & around the world.

====================
Careers are hard. But they're also affordable. And as president, IвЂ™ll give every worker and family in America the full pay and benefits that they deserveвЂ”and IвЂ™ll create a mix of good-paying American jobs and a brighter future for everyone else.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
====================
Businesses are worried about their profitability as the stock market tumbles. They're worried about their employees' wagesвЂ”because they're getting squeezed by unpredictable work schedules. They're worried about their ability to pay for essential health care. And they're worried about the unpredictable work environments that could change as the economy weakens.
To understand why companies are worried, I spoke to Eleanor Roosevelt about why they're squeezing wages, mental health records, and benefits. (I also asked why I'm worried.) HereвЂ™s what I heard:

A former student loan bahaviour who knew the wrongs were crushing student loan borrowers, did nothing wrong, and resigns today. I stand with @AyannaPressley and @Deb4Congress.

That's a question that should be asked of anyone who has held power in check for too long. But the Senate GOP used that power to block my #TwoCentWealthTax, an idea I've been pushing for a long time. It's an idea that will help middle class familiesвЂ”and weвЂ™ll make it bigger.pic.twitter.com/sWumSbG9g

I'm heartsick for the victims of this horrific attack and their familiesвЂ”and IвЂ™m committed to holding those responsible for the murder of Armen Babak Yarmolenko accountable.

A year ago today, President Obama signed an executive order that forced private prisons to close. Today, as I write, 46 states have implemented their own version of my plan, and Congress has signed onвЂ”many thanks to @KamalaHarris and @AyannaPressley.

The Senate should do its job and allow for a full inquiry into these allegations against Secretary Robert Gates. Then, Congress should do its job and allow for a full investigation.

The Trump administration has bungled the response to the coronavirus. But we can do more than that.

How do I know that? Because I've been following the Senate race in Massachusetts closely. I've been impressed by the grassroots commitment of our grassroots supporters. IвЂ™m grateful for their supportвЂ”and I'm grateful for their persistence to keep fighting for big, structural change.

For decades, the federal government has kept Blacks and Brown women from buying into one anotherвЂ”grudgingly, of course. But hereвЂ™s the thing: ThatвЂ™s exactly what they'd wanted to do: Buy into one anotherвЂ”and it's worked! And itвЂ™s helped to bring home larger swaths of white homeownership.

We did it. We scratched the edges and dug deepвЂ”from getting federal grants to the work of protecting and re-establishing communities and restoring Native rights. And we built a grassroots movement to fight for big, structural change. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this movement.

For decades, people around the world have been living with HIV/AIDS.

A handful of Big Tech companies have already acquired 1.5 million megabytes (MW) of data. TheyвЂ™re doing it in secret, with no one doing anything publicly.

====================
The daily toll of gun violence is staggering. In 2015, there were 1,495 mass shootings in the United States. We don't know how many more Americans will be killed in 2016 because of gun violence.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
====================
In 2015, more than 100 people were killed in the US by gun violence. It was often people of color who were the victims. We need to call this epidemic out for what it is: An epidemic. We need to end mass shootings and bring more people into our country.

The shooting is one of the worst moments of our presidentвЂ™s presidency. But itвЂ™s not the end of the fightвЂ”it's just a start. We must end the gun violence epidemic by enforcing strict standards for private gun sales, and by ending the practice of selling high-powered assault weapons and long guns.

We need a president who will fight for familiesвЂ”donвЂ™t back downвЂ”and who will move beyond partisan gerrymandering to reach across diverse demographics, from the farmers who helped elect him to the people who will never trust him. ThatвЂ™s what IвЂ™m fighting for.

The Trump administration is rolling back regulations in order to nibble around the edges of the problem. For example: Repealing the Affordable Care Act will mean fewer people will have insurance.

The #GOPTaxScam was successful, but it was not the only way it was paid for. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google paid over $1 billion for ads blocking vulnerable people from voting. #GOPTaxScam is another way these companies tried to block vulnerable people from voting.

For decades, AmericansвЂ™ve lived with the legacy of racist policies like Jim Crow. Black Americans were less likely to vote, and when theyвЂ™d receive a check from the government, theyвЂ™d vote against it. It was racist to try and hold down a job and support their family. It is racist to try and keep a job and live a life of poverty. It is racist to suggest that we need to turn back the clock. #BlackHistoryMonth

The daily toll of gun violence in our communities is staggering. On average, more than 1,300 people die from gun violence a dayвЂ”almost a thousand more than the number of gun crimes. That's because our country is gun-abusingвЂ”and the current gun violence epidemic is one that disproportionately impacts Black and Brown communities.pic.twitter.com/xDArZ7rtj

r/IAmA is a grassroots movement working to get Washington working for working peopleвЂ”and thatвЂ™s why IвЂ™m proudly endorsing @AyannaPressley. Ayanna has been a powerful advocate for health care, seniors, and families, and sheвЂ™ll do the same for me.
For decades, Washington has lived up to its responsibilities. Big, structural changes can come when the country isnвЂ™t readyвЂ”and when the political gridlock keeps fighting back. Today, though, I'm taking a moment to take a heart. I'm taking on the big battles head-onвЂ”because thatвЂ™s how we'll beat big, structural change.pic.twitter.com/bMzvaLhTJd

Our health care system is rife with problems, from the lowest-paid doctors to the most out-of-pocket expenses that can cover the costs of care itself.

The DOJ made a decision that year that changed the course of my entire career. It opened the door of opportunity and put me in the shoes of a young woman. That young woman was me. That young woman was me.

Donald Trump is trying to take our country hostage, and weвЂ™re in a panic.

I'll tell you a little about myself. I grew up in a family of doctors in Oklahoma. WeвЂ™re going to make America great againвЂ”and if you canвЂ™t go to college and help pay for it, chip in whatever you can.
I'm fighting for a government thatвЂ™ll make sure everyoneвЂ™s voiceвЂ”and my ownвЂ”is heard. We need to build a government that works for the people, not for giant drug companies and giant polluters. I'm proud to stand with @BostonStrong teachers, firefighters, and first responders.

ItвЂ™s not enough to just talk about their achievements. ItвЂ™s also not enough to pretend that no one is above the law. The Mueller investigation has resulted in the conviction of a Republican, and itвЂ™s not enough to just talk about how appalling that sentence looks. ItвЂ™s time for the criminal justice system to work for the peopleвЂ”not the rich and powerful.
 I have a special relationship with prosecutors and prosecutorsвЂ”but itвЂ™s not enough to just talk about the work they do. We need to build a movement to hold corrupt politicians to accountвЂ”not just some of the time, but everywhere:
                                    IвЂ™m grateful down to my toes for the work you do in these open records. Thank you for the opportunities you give me. Together, weвЂ™re building a movement to end corruption and bring down the rich and powerful.pic.twitter.com/IRUcOECyTj

The #DemDebate is getting closer and closer and we are seeing the clearest confirmation of what Democrats have been saying for months: вЂњIвЂ™m not for a thin-skinned bully like @realDonaldTrumpвЂ” IвЂ™m for a leader and a movement that inspires people all across this country.вЂќ

We spend a lot of time in federal buildings, because federal buildings are supposed to serve as the setting for all of our legal problems. But the Trump administration is trying to turn a blind eye to how they're being used.

At the same time, the Trump administration is rolling back regulations on agricultural pesticides, including requiring manufacturers to label products containing the chemicals.
         My administration will work with Congress to enact a #BlueNewDeal, including a two-cent duty on all polluting products, to address our toxic air, and a two-cent duty on pesticides that cause reproductive harm.

On day one of her presidency, IвЂ™ll sign a moratorium on new fossil fuel drilling offshore and on public lands until clean energy is a reality.

It's important to have a plan for how to deploy force in a crisis. That's why I've got a plan for how my plan to regulate the use of force in Virginia and nationwide will work. And I've got a plan for how to get the full force of a federal agency at or near your own peril.
My plan would establish a zero-tolerance policy for any violation of the law during the emergency, and I'll use the latest technology to combat domestic terrorism. No more detainers or detentions for domestic terrorism threats.https://www.vancity.com/news/local/lawrence/article236788542.html вЂ¦

The IRS has been a key part of the Trump administration, helping to approve over a billion dollars in taxpayer lobbying. This week, I called on the agency to return hundreds of thousands of tax returns from foreign governments.

So today, IвЂ™m announcing that, in a Warren administration, weвЂ™ll no longer be spending $1.5 trillion on a gun policy thatвЂ™s likely to put lives and money at risk.

For decades, Washington has worked great for the rich and the powerful. Working families never recovered. But when corporations and Wall Street wanted to liquidate a lot of the good they'd built, they could.

Dorchester is a small town, and like many small towns, there's a lot of speculation about why a shooting like this would happen. But itвЂ™s not. ItвЂ™s not because of any of the above.

We need to build a safe, secure world for all of our childrenвЂ”and I've got a plan for that.https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-what-i-saw-when-driving-the-border-e4be7d79d38 вЂ¦

Here's the deal: I've got a plan to invest at least $1 trillion in public educationвЂ”not just to the publicвЂ”but to our entire future. ThatвЂ™s why I'm fighting for public schools like every single day, so our kids get an education that they can thrive in.

====================
About a third of the money in the federal budget comes from business as usual. Business as usual means asking why should I pay for my children's health care and my education? Why isn't it more affordable? IвЂ™m fighting my heart out to fix these problems.

The conditions under which these scientists built the first climate-change-proof chambers of science are so extreme that no one has traveled there since they were chambers.

We can take bold action now to end gun violenceвЂ”and build an entire nationwide network of mental health care facilities and treatment centers to manage our gun violence epidemic.

This is an existential crisis and we need to end it now.https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/gun-violence?source=soc-WB-ew-tw-Rollout-20200302 вЂ¦

Today, IвЂ™m passing a bill to make sure that every African American in America gets the health care they needвЂ”and the health care they need as they continue to face this crisis.

The morning after a big fight, we lose. We lose because of the fear of losing. We lose because of the fear of losing. That's why we fight back. WeвЂ™re not a country that just loses a fighter.

For a long time, small business owners and small businesses owners have warned that Washington is hollowing out small businesses, hollowing out the small businessman, and hollowing out the giant.
Small businesses are small businesses that need a little help getting things starting. But Washington is hollowing out those small businesses. They're hurting American families. They're hurting Republican efforts to repeal & replace the ACA.

The Trump administration is trying to turn back the clock on the fight against the climate crisis. Enough. We need action now to end this crisis.https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/climate-crash/2054052/ вЂ¦

How do we know? Because we've seen firsthand how Washington works against the people's best interests. When Bruce replaced Mike Bloomberg, we saw the corruption that was at its worst when billionaires gave cushy posts to someone else. We saw how that corruption was stifled and used as leverage to protect financial interests.
                                         Bigotry is dangerous. Racism is dangerous. And corruption is dangerous when partisan rancor silences conversations and silences those who harm others. IвЂ™ll never tolerate that kind of behavior from any of my fellow candidatesвЂ”and I'll fight to end this climate crisis.

The time to take on Wall Street is upon us. Our government is on the verge of collapsing, and itвЂ™s only growing more dangerous as more Americans head to the polls.

The right to vote was recognized long ago in Virginia, and itвЂ™s one of the most important federal laws in our country. But right now, itвЂ™s under attack. @JayInslee and I have fought to make the right to vote law on the ballot in every state since the 1940s. We can do it again by expanding the right to voteвЂ”but only if we start by leveling the playing field for everyone else.

We're seeing a shift in how we think about health care and coronavirus, and the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for an attack on our Affordable Care Act. My administration will fight to protect our health care professionals and the patients they care forвЂ”not for-profit institutions that profit off of a coronavirus-like outbreak.
                                                                If pandemics strike, people will be more likely to seek medical care from coronavirus-tainted hospitals. That's good news. But coronavirus poses a threat to everyoneвЂ”including families, seniors, and students.
 We need to return power to the people, and IвЂ™ve got a plan for that. IвЂ™ve got a plan for that. IвЂ™ve got a plan to return power to the people. WeвЂ™re going to stop coronavirus by investing in early interventions to defeat it.https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/coronavirus?source=soc-

Gun violence is a public health crisis, and we need a solution that makes real, tangible health savings.

We need to talk about how we beat Donald Trump in 2020. But we don't have the technology to do it. 2020 is our moment in history. But there is a problem with this promise: It's been undermined by a few months of liesвЂ”and Donald Trump is still the Republican nominee.

It's been a while since I last updated my #MeToo moment. IвЂ™m very sorry I missed your motherвЂ™s trail, but IвЂ™m going to do it again.

For decades, Black Americans were excluded from voting, and often couldn't even cast a vote. This disenfranchisement set in motion the civil rights violations that led to the 1965 Voting Rights Act. It's time to re-enfranchise millions of Black Americans, and ensure they have the opportunity to vote safely.

A month before elections, voters are asked to find out who in their family voted on Election Day. But in most states, you still need to check your Social Security or Medicare records to be allowed to vote. And in some states, you could still be able to vote on the same day after that.

For a start, the child care system is holding back basic human rights. Yet child care costs are estimated to be higher than for-profit homesвЂ”$1,200 a monthвЂ”for families whoвЂ™ve been unable to work because of the costs. My plan to #FairChildCare would cancel these costs and provide a high-quality child care program so theyвЂ™re fully covered.
IвЂ™ve heard that child care costs are estimated to be as high as $1,600 a child every day for a single childвЂ”worth over $4,000 a dayвЂ”for families whoвЂ™ve struggled to get by. Why is this? ItвЂ™s because the system treats the families who have been hurt as though theyвЂ™re the only ones who get left behind.

For decades, the US has been a country that invested in giant corporations and steered our economy around racism and corruption. Today, that corruption is gone. We need to build an economy that works for every working family in America and ensure everyoneвЂ™s family is able to thrive.

For some reason, @realDonaldTrump and the Republicans are so obsessed with shredding the ACA that they don't even try to repeal it. #ObamacareForAll

Here's what I hear every day in WH: "We need to appoint a special prosecutor to look into this matter and make sure this investigation doesn't drag on for years."

On the campaign trail, I hear a lot of alarm bells. I'm scared, I'm angryвЂ”and I'm determined. So I took a deep breath and set my alarm. ItвЂ™s almost seven oвЂ”the day after I had my second babyвЂ”when I realized I was running against a woman who had been waiting for over a decade for the right answer to the right question.
                                                    And then I realized who I was and whyвЂ”it was too late. I had fought my heart out for womenвЂ™s health care, equal pay, and a college education. This is how we are going to winвЂ”together.

Trump may be successful in wooing business, but he's not. HeвЂ™s successful in wooing supporters to his White House and selling swanky diplomatic posts. HeвЂ™s successful in attracting more than a million grassroots supportersвЂ”and selling them fancy travel and diplomatic niches.

The only way we're going to beat Donald Trump is with a grassroots movement that is growing stronger.

IвЂ™m grateful to everyone who has given their time to knock on doors, make phone calls, and make phone callsвЂ”and thank you all for being part of this fight. WeвЂ™ll do this together. And weвЂ™ll have a president who will be a 100% American presidentвЂ”and thatвЂ™s gonna be a long road.

But in a Warren administration, we'll take big, bold steps to fight back: Making sure taxes on the people you're trying to hurt pay their fair share.https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/116630716185926416 вЂ¦

For decades, the rich and powerful have been keeping a stranglehold on Washington. Here's how theyвЂ™ve broken the law and broken our constitutionвЂ”putting a young child in danger, risking life in prison if caught, and spending months in detention.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
====================
For most of history, AmericaвЂ™s trade policy was based on one very clear principle: If itвЂ™s good for America, itвЂ™s good for trade. But bad for AmericaвЂ”and Donald TrumpвЂ™s right-wing agenda has hurt American jobs and our economy for decades.https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/good-for-trumps-bad-trade-policy-data-arrive/606048/ вЂ¦
                                                                                                                                                                
====================
A lot of billionaires are worried about their investment holding back the economy. But there's a whole lot of other stuff that these billionaires own, too. I mean, for instance, itвЂ™s all about how much they can squeeze your monthly retirement income before taxes.

Universal child care: Fair? Wrong. Under my plan to cancel student loan debt and invest in #UniversalChildCare, every child and family in America would be able to get high-quality, affordable child care and early education without worrying about costs.

Our country is failing our children and our grandchildren. We need a #WealthTax in America. We need universal child care. We need a #WealthTax in America. We need a #WealthTax in America.

We cannot just nibble around the edges of the problems we face.

Why We Need To Know: WeвЂ™re almost certain to call for impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump before heвЂ™s inaugurated. But impeachment isnвЂ™t the end of the world.

We need a Justice Department thatвЂ™s on the side of the people and wonвЂ™t back down from the criminal abuses they've been subjected to. This is an impeachment inquiry thatвЂ™s just the kind of investigation we need.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/12257721238358574496 вЂ¦

A handful of companies have already made their money off of holding giant corporations accountable. But now it's time to call more.

For decades, electricity has been the single most important source of electricity in our lifetimes. Today, that electricity comes with environmental and social costs. We have a #GreenNewDeal, but we have also a chance to make big structural changes to break our climate crisis.pic.twitter.com/6h3SipoYE
We shouldn't have to live like this. About a third of households have electricity, and nearly half of all electricity comes from fossil fuels. We need to cut our carbon footprint and help our neighbors with the biggest cuts to burn fossil fuels.http://ewar.ren/Clean-Energy-Plan вЂ¦

My heart goes out to all of those affected by the flu. My heart breaks for the people of Boston who are still without power and unable to get connected.

In spite of Trump's rhetoric, prescription drug companies continue to make billions of dollars in profits while patients lose their lives on average every year due to the abuse of drugs. My plan to end this crisis would require the companies that profit off this crisis to pay their fair share.

But when I got a second job, I was fired up about why I thought I could run against a Republican.

Remember when Mike Bloomberg said Bloomberg was a billionaire who rigged the game against his own company? He said "I'm a billionaire and that's why I'm running for president of the United States." Bloomberg wasn't kidding around.

Two of the three women who accused President Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey, were elected to Congress because they were women of color.

The Republican Party is afraid of women, and it's not because of an unspoken Republican belief that women aren't equal partners in crime. It's fear of women because they are paid less and are less likely to pursue careers in their field.

                                  I've got a plan to invest at least $50 billion in green research and innovationвЂ”and I've got a plan for that much bigger, more inclusive investment: a massive increase in research, development, and manufacturing.

The best way to make sure our economy works for working people is to invest in HBCUs & Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). @AyannaPressley & I have a plan to invest $100 billion in these places: https://medium.com/@teamwarren/a-fair-and-welcoming-immigration-system-8fff69cd674e вЂ¦ #LatinoHBCUs

On @morning_call, I'm asked how I'm going to get the Democratic nomination. I say I'm not afraid, because IвЂ™m running for president because thatвЂ™s what girls do. ItвЂ™s a perfectly legitimate goalвЂ”and IвЂ™ve got the best chance of winning.pic.twitter.com/Yv0H8Mo8Mi

The way we fight is by showing up and fighting, not just at the ballot box. When we take on Wall Street, drug companies, and big money donors, we can build a country and an economy that works for working familiesвЂ”and not just for the wealthy and well-connected.

====================
For months, Trump has abused the pardon authority to skip appointments and avoid testifying. Now, the White House says it will lift a gag on any White House documents that might aid witnesses during impeachment proceedings.
                                                                                                                                                                                                             The current president isnвЂ™t king, and his use of the pardon privilege to skip a hearing is unprecedented.

====================
The power to authorize the use of American military force has been abused since at least the days of the nation's first senator, John Quincy Adams. But our nation has also enacted an unwritten law that keeps us safer when we use force to protect ourselves and others.

The scales of power have shifted in America. TodayвЂ™s big decisions affect 1 in 4 American adults, but those decisions havenвЂ™t shifted the scale of American lives. We need to take bold action nowвЂ”starting with the #GreenNewDeal. ItвЂ™s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan.
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
====================
Here's how it works: Under the Trump administration, HHS has taken a tough line on enforcing rules on climate change. On the first day an executive order is signed into law, the White House says it will take steps to protect the planet but won't enforce them until Congress acts.

====================
Scott BrownвЂ™s failure to get his priorities straight has put our country into a vice gripвЂ”putting our children and families at risk, and potentially putting the next President in the White House in the danger of impeachment.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
====================
On the same day that Trump signed an executive order that temporarily banned refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US, @DepSecs was helping to organize an attack across the street on a hopeful immigrant from Jordan.
On 9/19, @realDonaldTrump sent letters to families of those who have died in Syria & Jordan begging them to stay home. Today, I joined Jordan's King Abdullah IIIII to urge him to take action. Tonight, IвЂ™m backtracking & urging global leaders to help. Stay home.
We have a moral responsibility to protect our own lives. That responsibility starts with Congress. No matter what the next president does, theyвЂ™re supposed to act.

Here's the thing: When people ask me why I give a $50 bonus to wealthy donors, I don't just give them a raise. I give them a raise, too. I just give them a raise. We canвЂ™t just sit around and pretend this isnвЂ™t happening. We have to fight back. And IвЂ™ve got a plan for that.https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-to-strengthen-our-corporate-resort-by-200000-f5214dcd023b вЂ¦

Patsy and I were having lunch outside our New Hampshire town hall last night, and Patsy asked what my plan is to stop gun violence. I told her: Stop talking about it. We need to talk about it.

====================
We need a president who will fight for our country, not for his donors and his investors. I'll fight to make sure that everyone who needs a health insurance is covered. I'll expand Medicaid, make high-quality mental health care available to everyone, and push to expand the definition of mental illness to everyone with a mental illness.
      We need a #WealthTax on every family, so that when a family has a problem paying rent, theyвЂ™ll be able to pay it off without fear of evictionвЂ”despite the threat of eviction. IвЂ™ll level the playing field for families by guaranteeing a basic basic income and investing $100 billion over the next 10 years in basic research and education to help people with complex financial problems understand how our economy is working.
My heart goes out to @AlysonScott's family and friends. He and his wife went through a difficult time last November, but we are so grateful for the powerful words he wrote about how lucky we are to have you in this fight. We'll always have you in this fightвЂ”we owe you a debt you can't repay.

====================
Mr. President: You've been a major driver of the 2008 financial crash, and you've pledged to look into investigating Donald Trump and his associates further. The American people deserve to hear why you think that's the right path.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
====================
We need to call out white supremacy and bigoted language and ideas repeatedly and explicitly. Democrats can win if we start by acknowledging the deep problems in our country's foundation, building a grassroots movement, and fighting back against them when they threaten to undermine our democracy.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
====================
Now let's be clear: If we don't attack Trump with a coherent plan, he'll be unable to handle the chaos in Syria and will instead choose to roll back the rules to protect his own self-interest.

For the past year, IвЂ™ve been traveling around the country talking about how IвЂ™m running for president. IвЂ™m running to be president of the entire United States. But IвЂ™m not running to be president because IвЂ™m not afraid. IвЂ™m not afraid because I believe that a candidate for presidentвЂ”even one with a demonstrated record and a demonstrated record of standing up for the people of New HampshireвЂ”will be able to stand up against the hate and bigotry of the Trump administration.pic.twitter.com/0qOLiAZE3uR

For decades, Washington has lived by a set of rules: 1. No foreign government should get too close to your family, your friends, your neighbors. 2.

We need a foreign policy that puts the country after us first.

No one is above the law.pic.twitter.com/Mp7u5f6gZd

====================
The majority of people who voted illegally did so to elect Donald Trump. And they were exercising their right to vote.

We need to confront the deep-seated racism and hate that Donald Trump has stoked against Black Americans, women, and people of color.

Universal child care and universal pre-k for every baby is a win for our communities, but itвЂ™s a win for the system that gave birth to itвЂ”and a loss for everyone else.

====================
The man in the White House is trying to poison the airwaves and water to the point where some have trouble seeing the damage. It's not about politics, it's about an administration that has taken everything we could throw at it and put it into a thin-skinned attempt to denigrate and divide us.

We should be spending less time worrying about the effects of climate change on workers and industries, and more time focusing on the positive impacts of these reforms on the working families who depend on our products and services.

What if we send @realDonaldTrump's racist wall a warning? For decades, the odds of any serious policy improvement have been consistently stacked against the odds.

It's been seven years since the Oklahoma City bombing, but news of another terrible event haunts us every day. Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the victims and their loved onesвЂ”and we mourn with them.

Our best moments of the campaign are when we find out what's broken and when we get up and fight back. On Day One, I'm proudly endorsing @CPalzOfIAa for re-election as mayor of Chicago.

ItвЂ™s time to end gun violence. And we can start with a plan that makes real, structural change so that no one is left in the dark about the devastating toll of gun violenceвЂ”and that includes making sure it happensвЂ”by banning the sale of .45 ACP, .38 ACP, and .44 ACP.
Gun violence is a public health crisis, and we need to treat it like one. The United States has a gun violence epidemic, but Congress hasn't done anything to tackle it. We need a president who will fight to end gun violence, not for his or her own family, but for the majority of Americans living with it.

Ranking: #1 Country in the World for Small Businesses - Smaller businesses are number one and we have to work together to hold our competition accountable.
Small businesses make up 2-3% of America's total economy and account for less than 2% of all new buildings. When I set up the Small Business Equity Loan Program, I invested $100 million in two- and four-year-old startup companies to help entrepreneurs find real financing.

One year ago today, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, leaving more than 3 million people dead. The Trump administration tried to respond, but Puerto Rico's people refused to give in and let the federal government handle the disaster.

Us, more people are getting crushed by mountains of student loan debt than are ever likely to enroll at a public college. My plan to cancel debt for 42 million Americans would cancel that debt for 43 million students and college students across this country.
We need a president who will fight for studentsвЂ”not tell them to throw away their credit cards. We need a president who will be tough on the pockets of Wall Street and tough on the pockets of big lenders. We need a president who will fight back.
WeвЂ™ll have a president who will set priorities and who can mobilize the country. WeвЂ™ll have a president who will be there for our kids and our grandkids, and who will make sure we have a chance to succeed. WeвЂ™re not going to beat Donald Trump with a candidate who silences women with whom heвЂ™s on a business trip.

For decades, our country's redlining laws prevented African American families from owning homes.

For decades, our countryвЂ™s trade policy has been a result of two sets of rules: 1) A foreign government that wishes to buy American politicians & elections 2) A hostile foreign government that seeks to buy American elections. WeвЂ™ve seen the Trump administrationвЂ™s love-hate relationship with the trade policy industry wane in the past two decades.

Rising sea levels are already displacing communities, and the consequences are accelerating. This week, I released a plan to tackle climate change head on, but it's too early to fully address these challenges.
                                                      Climate change is already an existential threatвЂ”and we are already dealing with the consequences.

Cripes have been known as the bustle of America's middle class. But they're also the preserve of a small group of well-connected billionaires and giant corporations.

The 2016 election was a critical moment in our country's history. But our government is broken. I know how to fix it through a two-pronged attack: firstly, by holding Republican primary voters accountable. And secondly, by expanding the right to vote.
                                 I have a plan for an expanded criminal and voter registration system that will strengthen the voices of our neighbors and foster closer ties between our Washington and state capitals.

We should recognize that the interests of giant corporations and their investors are not just at risk, they're also vulnerable. This includes those who are working on behalf of the Trump administrationвЂ”particularly those who are struggling to get by.

This resistance isn't about politics. This resistance is about the fear of what is possible.

This morning we launched a campaign to get @BarackObama electedвЂ”because the status quo is broken. And we need a president who will fight for working familiesвЂ”not tell the story of how his daddy got rich and then spent his life in prison.
Donald Trump made big, structural changes that put his corrupt administration in place of catering to the interests of giant corporations and billionaires. He has no plans to reform this policy.https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/the-trump-administration-is-the-enemy-of-working-families-policy-2020-9 вЂ¦

====================
For most presidents, itвЂ™s more difficult to get elected. But @BarackObama did what any other first ladyвЂ”she ran for officeвЂ”and she beat a popular incumbentвЂ”a man with a thin skin. We canвЂ™t beat a popular incumbent again.

We just won't go back. We can't go back to 2008, when the economy crashed and the public lands were a mess. The Trump administration wants to put people over islands and sell them off as a "third world" territory.

A few hours later, Trump signed an executive order that criminalizes any financial scam perpetrated by the Trump administrationвЂ”even those that involve money laundering.

We need someone who will fight for working people. Someone who will fight for health care, a government that works for the peopleвЂ”not billionaires and giant corporations.
                             We need someone who will fight to protect our reproductive rights. Someone who will fight to make sure every American can have access to safe, legal abortion. Someone who will be held accountable for the choices we madeвЂ”not a man or a woman.
                                                                                                                                                                 
====================
We wonвЂ™t stop until every single person is free to be who they areвЂ”and loved. WeвЂ™ll start with a government that understands that no one is above the lawвЂ”and that includes the president of the United States.

In the meantime, here are just a few of the things IвЂ™ve got in my heart:
IвЂ™m bringing a new vision to Washington: Immigrant communities are more likely to face criminal justice problems and experience violence. I want to expand the definition of Domestic Violence to include it. This includes comprehensive criminal justice reform, including mandatory minimums and early release for domestic abusers.https://twitter.com/TeamWarren/status/11560197477777454412 вЂ¦
                                                                                                                                                                         
====================
In a Warren administration, weвЂ™ll use every tool we have to defeat the climate crisisвЂ”and weвЂ™ll start with the rules: No fracking, no new fossil fuel drilling offshore, no new offshore drilling.
                                       Climate change is an existential crisis, and we need to act fast to end it before itвЂ™s too late. IвЂ™ve got a plan to protect our planet and level the playing field: http://ewar.ren/Protect-Our-Planet
                              Climate change is an existential crisis, and we need an administration that will fight to stop itвЂ”and we need to begin by rooting out the corruption in Washington. https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/protecting-our-planet?source=soc-WB-ew-tw-Rollout-20200129 вЂ¦

I do not just own a piece of @BostonGlobe.com, but that company owns more than a million shares in Bloomberg.

We know whatвЂ™s broken, we know how to fix it.

This week, we released the first of many plans to reform gun violence prevention and response. We'll ask gun owners to share their stories of being victims of gun violence in the aftermath of a crime. And we'll ask Congress to act immediately to ban assault weapons.

We need to end mass shootings with comprehensive gun violence prevention policies that keep everyone safeвЂ”not a thin slice at the top.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/us/mass-shootings.html вЂ¦

When I first ran for Senate in 2012, we had a very different idea of what a fair tax code looked like. We changed our mindsets and fought together to protect our rights.

When I first ran for the Senate, Massachusetts was the only state left on the planet that didn't have a minimum wage increase. It was obscene. It hurt women's wages. It was time to cut our federal minimum wage. And I have a plan for how IвЂ™ll make the big, structural change we need to fix it.

Polaris is a pinkie promise that I made to a friend who was in the military after the war. But our government isn't on its way to big, structural change.

The daily toll of gun violence is staggering. From 2012 to 2016, 1.5 million Americans were killed in the United States from 2012 to 2016. Gun violence is preventable, it happens.

For the past few years, IвЂ™ve been largely silent about the scale of the illegal immigration problem that weвЂ™re in a fight with Puerto Rico for years to come.

We'll ban new fuel tanks, pesticides, and herbicides, tackle rising sea levels, and invest in clean energy sources like solar and wind. We'll fight climate change with a Warren administration.

We should invest in green research. I'll fight for a world powered by electricity from all of us instead of some fossil fuel-based energy source. We should invest in green health research instead of cherry-picking one industry over the other. We should invest in green home health research instead of cherry-picking one industry over the other.

We need to see big, structural changes to our economy to combat climate change. I'll fight to build a green future using all of our tools, including all of our labor unions. We need to invest in green infrastructure, invest in green products, and invest in green buildings. We need to invest in green products.

Take a look at my plan to invest $800 billion in HBCUs & Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). http://ewar.ren/Fund-Students pic.twitter.com/9iRp40HPv
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
====================
In an attempt to protect our democracy, Texas has banned the carrying of small arms. Imagine what our country will look likeвЂ”when the @CBP agents who shot and killed 9 people at Pulse are goneвЂ”when we have the full force of the federal government in our corner.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
====================
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was indicted on corruption charges after donating $1 million to Democratic presidential candidates and groups. Now Bloomberg is out of office and the results are still up in the air. Bloomberg must resign or his future as mayor of New York will be threatened.
                                                                                                                                                    The climate crisis is a wake-up callвЂ”but not too late. We need to act now to defeat this climate crisis, and IвЂ™ll fight alongside my friend @BarackObama in the White House.

Giant corporations like Amazon can profit off of our children.

====================
For decades, the practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors has sucked in Washington and cushioned the wealthy's pockets.
ThatвЂ™s corruptionвЂ”plain and simple. My administration will end this practice of giving a huge tax break to the wealthiest familiesвЂ”and will ban the practice of auctioning off giant diplomatic posts to the highest bidder.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/04/trump-wants-to-cut-the-50-million-tax-under-trump-grants-7 вЂ¦

I asked President Kennedy to appoint a secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher and teaches at both public schools and private schools. He said no. We need a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher and teaches at both public schools and private schools. This should be a public optionвЂ”and it should be no surprise that he doesn't want to go.https://twitter.com/amberd1991/status/1172249132087762240 вЂ¦

For decades, the South Pacific island nation of ChelyabinskвЂ”which has been on the front lines of the conflict in SyriaвЂ”has been hamstrung by a disease epidemic that threatens the lives of millions. In a Warren administration, weвЂ™ll fight to end these devastating health problems.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/health/syria-infected-papua-s-least-fatal-organ-in-history.html вЂ¦

Staff at @TheDailyShow spent hours last week gathering signatures to put up $1 million to elect Jon @Ossoff & @Maggie_Hassan. I'm proud to fight alongside them to protect our environment & our children's health.

Congress has to act. I'm committed to seeing the health care and prescription drug marketplaces open and open to everyoneвЂ”not just those at the top.https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/33/house-press-releases-trump-medical-desire-medical-doses-20200226 вЂ¦

With an average monthly income of $50,000, it's hard to find work after school. My plan for paid family and medical leave would give workers and their families paid for with something other than child care, daycare, and library workвЂ”a decent retirement.pic.twitter.com/1miGKb1jQD

====================
I know how to get our campaign fundraising to match our state's needs. Right now, our campaign is taking on small loans and giving small-dollar donors a tour of our campaign headquarters. We'll use that trust to get our campaign on the trail and grow our movement.

For decades, public financing of medical research has been the primary source of funding for pharmaceutical companies. But today, it's monopolies that are squeezing research. My new plan would end this money-grubbing and return it directly to the people.https://www.vox.com/2019/7/18/18688029/warren-public-funding-public-science-meds вЂ¦

We know what's broken, we know how to get it fixed, and we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. So tonight IвЂ™m rolling out a vision of how IвЂ™ll build a grassroots movement to get it doneвЂ”and tonight IвЂ™m rolling out a list of things IвЂ™ve learned in the process. Take a look:
