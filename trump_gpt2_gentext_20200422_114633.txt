There are many great & beautiful things to be having with the United States, but the most important, and perhaps, the most important, is having a General. I am grateful for the warm relationship the U.S. has had with the world since the founding of our Country in 1812.

...As the World watches, on television, as we record the devastation from Hurricane, we must also remember that the President of Ukraine, who was in total shock and shock before the call, was in total shock when he heard the call.

They will!

We have now learned that the IG Report on the Clinton/Russia Investigation was illegally leaked to the press, by a very dishonest journalist, and the Democrat establishment! Remember, this was AFTER the Dems were forced to concede that they could not win in 2020 without a Republican taking the White House!

Comcast CEO Brian Roberts: вЂњThey (NBC, CBS, MSNBC) are getting hit and slammed, like nobody has been hit or slammed in the history of journalism...And yet, from the day I announced I was going to be single, they stayed by me for 24 hours straight, and they continue to stay by me for 24 hours straight.вЂќ @LouDobbs One of the greatest hoaxes of all time!

The beauty and charm of the Democrat Party is that it has lost a lot of members over the last 3 years, & every one of them was a winner for the Party, including my very successful run for President in 2016. With all of the Dems doing, and doing well, what with all of the big wins!

I am sooo pleased to be in the White House, with the incredible men and women of the FBI, that they are doing a GREAT job of stopping people from getting into our country. They are a real threat to our national security, and the Democrats must give us a man who will do the job well again!

The Democrats want Illegal Immigrants to come into our country, and have no right to do so. The fact is that they are bad for our country, & they are not going to stand for the sanctity of our country. They want Open Borders, which means No Crime, Drugs, and Criminals. Democrats should give us a man who will make Country great again!

As I have stated many times, вЂњNo President in history has seen more terror & chaos than President Donald J. Trump.вЂќ Thank you FBI, Justice, State & Local Law Enforcement, Law Enforcement Officers, Law Enforcement Officers, and now, after many years, the Shutdown! The Democrats should get together

It will all happen!

Comcast was caught red handed and in many ways worse. The problems were the incompetent management of the highly successful @NBCNews @SteveHiltonx and the interference of then Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Make no mistake, NBC is a disaster, the вЂњRatвЂќ of the Economy and Government Regulations, the вЂњDumb & DumberвЂќ of the Companies, is the worst. Ratings are now way down and they have lost all credibility. Comcast has gone bonkers.вЂќ @greggutfeld @foxandfriends I like Comcast, theyвЂ™re losers!

It is now well known that the European Union does not like me on Trade because of the Tariffs I place on them. They donвЂ™t like the prospect of a United States based Trade Mission in their country, and they donвЂ™t want to pay much more in order to do business in the U.S.A. They also want me to be successful in that they have treated the United States very badly in that I have been treated very unfairly in the past by the U.S.A. They never liked the idea of having a United States based Ambassador in that it would save so much money!

President Trump and Mexico are very happy, very proud of themselves, and there is no reason for them to be doing this anymore. Mexico should respect the U.S. commitment on Trade, and we will continue to have a great working relationship, but with China we should also respect the commitment on Trade. The U.S. has made great deals - and they love it!

A great deal of good news and bad news for the Republican Party. Some are good and some are not. But if you really get to know the President and the people who run it, and if you get to know the Attorney General (and if you do), you will find that the good news is very good....
....The Fake News Media is working overtime to discredit me, and all Republicans. I am the only person who would do the job properly, and I have done it before! Look at the disasters from the past two years - Oklahoma, Florida, New York & Texas. Fake News is now coming out of the Failing @nytimes....

It is now the duty of the United States, as the indispensable and powerful Central Bank of the United States, to respond to the severe and devastating impacts of the El Nino & Nino Buzz. The Federal Reserve has, from the date of our election, done NOTHING!

I am tired of hearing the Democrats talk about how important Russia is to the U.S., but theyвЂ™re just playing games.

Bob Mueller has done a terrible job of stopping money from coming into the United States.

When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. This way they will not be forced to work or do other activities. We donвЂ™t have to put them in....https://www.foxnews.com/us-visas-japan-abuse-report-tsunami-spread-in-first-time-since-conveyor-crash-on-navy-navy-coronavirus-n25545818 вЂ¦

The United States Senate, led by failed Democrat Dianne Feinstein, continues to push the dangerous and unpopular Immigration and Security Bill even when all of its parts will not fully cover it. On top of this, the Dems have failed on all fronts in the Impeachment Hoax. It is time for the Senate to finally fix what has been a long and boring sham!

The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are going CRAZY. They want to take away the Open Borders, High Taxes, and Open Borders that so strongly Secure our Country. They want Open Borders, which means High Crime, Drugs and Trafficking, High Taxes and Crime, and High Tax, High Illegal Immigrants. Democrats must approve!

We are winning. The Fake News Media in our country, together with the Radical Left, do not want to report the good news. They are CRAZY and want to take away the Open Borders, High Taxes, High Crime, and Open Borders that so strongly Secure our Country. The Dems, on the other hand, want Open Borders, High Taxes and Crime, High Crime, and High Crime, and High Crime, and High Crime, and High Crime, and High Crime and High Taxes!

The Democrats should finally fix the disgusting Impeachment Hoax, which has led to the worst Economy in the History of our Country, the worst Stock Market

We are moving into the third quarter with record growth. We have fantastic new products at our new plant in Ohio, and our Country is doing great! We are building plants and moving our factories overseas. We have record unemployment and wage increases. We have the best economy in our countryвЂ™s history!

....Trade negotiators are not in a position to put a price on our terrible Trade Deal with China and South Korea. We are getting great marks from our Federal Reserve Board, and our 20-year Energy Independence Partnership is building the largest Farm, Energy and Infrastructure Farm anywhere in the World.

....Today, we announced that the U.S. will impose Tariffs of up to 130% on China, South Korea and Japan as part of our long-awaited deal on Strength & Prosperity. These Tariffs will be administered through the @FEMA_Bureau and will be applied to all Federal Government Agencies, businesses and industrialists....

...Trade Deals, and the economy, are booming in China. Thousands of small and medium scale companies are leaving China for the USA, and our Country is doing GREAT! Many of these companies are moving to the USA, and many more, because of strong Tariffs on their product. The U.S. subsidizes these businesses, and encourages them to leave!

The answer is that we have one of the worst & most Corrupt Criminal Justice in the History of our Country!

I was thrilled to be in South Carolina last night, standing in the Great State of Marietta, to defend the lives of our precious young women. I am certain that the people of that wonderful State have seen first hand the devastation that is being caused by the illegal & costly & foolish policies of the Democrats.

Thank you for the nice remarks by @SenRicardoRivera in South Carolina last night. I am sure he will do well in the Great State of South Carolina.

The Washington Post and the Democrat Party treated me and the Fake News Media like second-class citizens, only to have me take in tens of millions of dollars from China, for which they would institute Tariffs on all of our manufactures. So unfair to the U.S.A., that they are now charging companies $ Zero!

I have been calling China for two years. They laugh at the dumbest statement of my career, that they are not subject to the WTO. Actually the Chinese have taken to the street, arms and money, and are no longer in a position to threaten me or the United States - long ago!

I watch the Fake News @washingtonpost and the Democrat Party keep talking about the importance of intellectual property and free speech. They have nothing but hatred of me, the President of the United States, and the American people. The U.S. is very respected within the World, and the digital rights of its citizens is very respected within the U.S.A.

The United States has the absolute right to protect its own citizens online without retribution or interference from China - a right that has long been respected and respected around the world. I have always respected the rule of law and freedom of speech, and thought that the U.S. stands in the way of that right. IвЂ™ll always find a better

The Federal Reserve has been вЂњbullsh*t all of вЂњthe last three years.вЂќ I only hope that this will be the year the Federal Reserve does something that has never been done before: it rates & signs....
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
====================
Europe has put tremendous pressure on China, and yet China continues to show such a strong & unwavering demand for its products & services. The United States, on the other hand, is charging very high prices for our products & services, a practice that goes along with the practice of unfair trade. This is our duty, and it is strictly on the U.S.

We know, the Fake News, that the Democrats have made a really bad deal with the American people. They have made it impossible for them to run against 2020 (which they hope will be a disaster), and they have zero credibility.

Our country is being ripped off by outside interests, some of which are truly evil, such as the Chinese, because of a policy of вЂњmaximum pressureвЂќ on the U.S. Coast Guard.

We are being held back by our partners, many of whom have already committed to staying until the last minute.вЂќ
North Korea and the United States have agreed, together, to test-fire a range of different missiles capable of reaching the United States. This marks a major step towards fully testing a range of ICBMs. Will it ever end? No pressure, we have agreed to suspend joint military drills for 12 months. The last time such a deal was done was in 1990.

The USMCA Trade Deal
The USMCA Trade Deal is moving along smoothly, with many additional countries signing or substantially signing agreements. There are many trade barriers and barriers to bring our country closer to the full potential of the Chinese economy. You cannot put us 100 miles away from any of these barriers and barriers will be broken! Our country is doing great!

• European Union countries must get access to clean water and clean air in order to produce electricity. We must get it today. We must protect our rivers, our States, and our farmers. We must cut down on fertilizer runoff. We must end the poison & wasteful importation of our foodstuffs.

True, but lets get the big news straight, Mexico is considered the number one importer of Illegal Immigrants into the United States. They make it so that we pay, and we take, the massive cost. Mexico is not our problem, we just TAKE. We are doing MUCH better than China, the envy of the world.

 The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, must act today to protect the innocent lives of the two little boys who were killed and badly injured in the attack on the Tube.

The people that I watched last night were great, and the Fake News that they do is very sad!

Now he has his greatest ever day, a big day!

A man named Jerome Corsica was arrested and accused of ripping off the Trump Administration. He is a total loser who has made many bad decisions. He is a disgrace to our Country & must prison for the crime of disloyalty to our beloved Country. Jerome was also going to do bad things, like stealing cars from people, but he didnвЂ™t.

Proud to have STEVE INSTRUCTIONS, and great experience, assisting with the great legal and humanitarian crisis facing our Country. He will be joining the Administration in two weeks, so my prayers and best wishes!
I am so proud of myself and the Great State of Texas for having done a FANTASTIC job of policing and policing the Border. The Dems have taken care of Border Patrol for decades, & the Military has been fantastic. We have done FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER MEXICO HATE BORDER!

President TrumpвЂ™s top intelligence official suggested that there may be Russian collusion with the Trump campaign to help him win the November election, a subject that would be very difficult to separate from the crimes committed by the Russian government.вЂќ @LouDobbs

Nancy Pelosi, who is trying to run her very unpopular Democrats, has done nothing for working-class people. She has given Social Security and Medicare to companies far too expensive to rebuild. She gave up Sanctuary Cities to big drug companies. She has given Tax Cuts to the military and law enforcement!

website вЂњfor saleвЂќ has gone down fast. The worst part is that people are still looking for it because we are doing really well (thank you Bezos).

President Trump is a winner who has made tremendous progress in his first term, despite the most difficult economic times on record.

====================
Comcast workers have waited longer than ever to receive their pay increases (NBC, Comcast, NBC), and now Comcast is complaining that they wonвЂ™t be given overtime, because of the вЂњholidayвЂќ rule. This is Comcast trying to scare workers into paying higher wages. NBC and NBC, they want overtime pay. NBC should start fixing the terrible & expensive practice!

Tiger Woods is competing for his soul as the word Tiger is being tossed around in the ratings and fad magazines. No, it is not. Strong, confident, and very smart Tiger Woods is losing his soul trying to recapture his youth and glory. No, it is not.

If it werenвЂ™t for the fact that they donвЂ™t have a clue as to what this means, I would be surprised at least one million times (thatвЂ™s what they say on TV), and maybe many millions of times, that Donald J. Trump is going to win. But I am, and always have been, a huge fan of the good job the DNC & Trump base, & the Democrats, are not!

BACKGROUND:

While we have a long and comprehensive list of medical conditions, including all congenital malformations, I have not seen a single doctor recommending that women delay ovulation because of the risk to the fetus. We have a long way to go.

I have spoken to numerous women who do not want to be identified. They would like to reiterate their concerns, but there is no reason to be doing that now. Any decision is up to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

I am pleased to announce that, effective 3 P.M. on the Census, I will be awarding $2.5 million to States in the Southern Border. This will go directly to the States that have the greatest number of Illegal Immigrants. States with the greatest number of illegal immigrants are those that have the most dangerous communities.

We have a long way to go. The Supreme Court, and everyone else who watches, is going to have to define Presidential powers. The question is, do we have to solve this problem now or not?

We are winning. NAFTA is dead, the USA is thriving and producing for the world as never before. China, on the other hand, is starting to look like a version of NAFTA that is far stronger & more dangerous than NAFTA itself. The USA is far better off outside of this deal, even though we are

The United States has made historic progress in its fight against terrorism. The fight against radical Islamic terrorism is now over, and we can never be satisfied.

China banned certain Agricultural Products from sale in their country. This is very bad news for our Country, and a huge trade surplus with China. China has stated that it wants to make sure that no product from their country is sold into the United States. This is very bad for our Country!

So, now that the Democrats have given up on the so-called Mueller Report, it would be nice if they would just concede that there was NO COLLUSION, there was NO OBSTRUCTION, and there was NO MURDER. I would do it again, and again, and again. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 When the Democrats came back from vacation and said that they were going to release the transcripts of the two Whistleblowers, I said that they had NO RIGHT UNDER ANY LAW to testify, and that there was NO COLLUSION. They were just happy to give a nice political talking point...

When you see a picture of your favorite President hitting the political establishment, and then immediately immediately immediately sitting back and being hit so hard, you are not only blind - you are also dumb. The picture was taken from the White House, and hit so hard, that it is hard to see it. The hit & run, by the media, is so bad for the Democrat Party!

In addition to the massive crime and crime wave sweeping the U.S., China, and all over the world, we must also address the many dangers posed by North Korea, the most dangerous place on earth. If the United States does anything that we deem necessary, it must act quickly and decisively!

There is no way that the Russian Government can be corrupt and/or compromised, even though there is great distrust and distrust in the media and even in the Democrat Party. The Russian Government is a lawless, never ending game of bribery, fraud and many other forms of corruption. It never ends!

Time for a big renovation of the horrible, and costly, Ice Barrier in the Great State of Minnesota. $1.6 Billion dollars spent and rebuilt, itвЂ™s going to cost $2.6 Billion dollars. I want to give it a try because it is soooo much better than nothing. Our Barrier has recently been replaced by a high tech product such as Intel® Xeon W-Case. Intel® Xeon W-Case costs $3000 less than a WORD BOMber. Got it done!

The Democrats are going CRAZY. They are focused on the Impeachment Hoax, a very bad, if any, trial for the President - and the Dems are doing nothing but waste time on the Impeachment Scam.

вЂњWhy does it never end for Barack Obama for nothing? The economy is the best ever, and ObamaвЂ™s predecessor did nothing wrong. Now ObamaвЂ™s got a Democrat Congress, and heвЂ™s got a Democrat President.вЂќ @BenSasse @RandPaul вЂ¦
The Democrats have been told, and now rightfully, that there is only one thing going on - a crime of the highest order in our Country. ThatвЂ™s why the Crime rate in the United States is the highest ever, by far.

The United States is here to stay. We are doing very well in our negotiations with China, Japan and South Korea. The only thing we are missing is the CoronaVirus, which is killing many thousands of Americans each year!

Remember the helicopter crash in South Carolina two weeks ago? There was nobody there, and the Governor was looking for a troublemaker who could make a mistake. He had a helicopter crash!

Many of our companies, including the long time outstanding Lockheed Martin, have been put at a very big and costly disadvantage.

Joe Biden? Oh well, heвЂ™ll not get elected because of his poor economic numbers (which are numbers, by the way), and heвЂ™ll be a total loser because his numbers are just starting to drop.

We do know that the only way for the Democrats to take back the House is if they have a very bad and unbalanced majority. They have a very bad and unbalanced majority in the Senate, and without a Democrat controlled House, there would not be a national economy, healthcare, or anything else.вЂќ @Varneyco

Europe is so worried about their own currency and their own joblessness, that they should be able to rest easy, and we should be able to. They donвЂ™t want to go there, they do not want to go there!

The story on Charlottesville is a total Fake! The Fake News never mentions the good will & unity that we have in Charlottesville. They never mention the hatred, or the violence that must be endured, or the cost to our Country! They never mention the money that must be incurred. They never mention the money that must be done.And remember, our Country cannot allow the Democrats to destroy our great Flag and Honor. So bad for our Country!

The Mainstream Media is not talking the вЂњwordsвЂќ of the great people of our Country. They love hating the President, heвЂ™s doing exactly what he said he would do, but they canвЂ™t seem to wrap their heads around the fact that this President will someday do exactly what he said he would do - and I am there, ready to do it!

The Democrats are fighting for the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, by the thousands. вЂњNo Pressure.вЂќ They hate Trump, heвЂ™s made all of the wrong moves. They want to impeach him for a second time. But this time they want to take his Radical Left, Do Nothing position and put it on the Supreme Court. What do you do when you lose an election?

The Democrats want to
====================
Remember when he were saying that the Democrats were compromising on the 2020 Election because they were against the phony Russia Investigation, and now he is saying that they were on the Russia, Russia, Russia Investigation, and they are now trying to hide the results of the Mueller Report from the American public. All based on DonвЂ™t know, but we are getting closer!

Strongest Intelligence Community achievements, by far, include the establishment of the National Counterterrorism Center, retaking the Cryptome of the World terrorist leader in 2015, and securing the Border.

So the WSJ Editorial Board, who have gone totally off the rails since the first day I announced I was running for President, is now asking me to be their Presidential Editorial Board. They always do, never accountable to Congress or to the American People. Their Board is no longer made up of NONE!

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) recently stated that the Democrats are trying to use the Impeachment Scam against President Trump, but they canвЂ™t find any evidence that President Trump is guilty of any crimes.вЂќ @foxandfriends

A few days ago, in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Japan, I had the honor of flying to Japan to meet with the parents and team of Prime Minister Abe Lincoln. They love their son so much, and yet he was unable to because of his poor health.

 Nancy Pelosi has been told that by the Fake News Mainstream Media, which has done irreparable harm to the Democrat Party, for years, because they have become so good at lying to the American People. They are truly the Enemy of the People!

Ever since the Election, the Radical Left Democrats, who have gone through 10 years of WITCH HUNT, have been forced to go through the very boring and not consider the many, many legal & factual questions they must ask of the American people.

A big day for the U.S.A. and Mexico tonight! Mexico will soon be imposing FAR MORE sanctions on the U.S.A., Europe and all businesses that we have in Mexico. If we donвЂ™t stop them, our Country will be forced to Tariff us many times, and they will retaliate!
 ....But Mexico is not paying us, and we have not paid them, because they have treated the United States in the past, and will not pay us, for many years. So weвЂ™re off to the races tonight, and tomorrow!
....Because of the Democrats, we were only able to use a very small portion of our $800 Billion Dollars for the Military, and other things, while at the same time getting reimbursed for the very bad Trade Deals we are all trudging along. We will be reimbursed big time, because weвЂ™ve got your military and your protection!

saying she wants to be President. Impeachment Hoax is a total waste of time, and a total waste of money, because she can barely run a campaign.

CNN is the most dishonest and dangerous show on television right now. Fake CNN is doing everything possible to make Bernie Sanders look like a loser, only by his own efforts, like his millions, will he be able to recover. CNN is corrupt and dangerous. BernieвЂ™s campaign is far bigger & more successful than anyone could have ever anticipated!

While CNN may be bigger than CNN, CNN is only a fraction of a millimeter of a human being. CNNвЂ™s Don Lemon, on CNN, is a mere puppet for Don, who is only interested in making Bernie look bad. DonвЂ™t listen to what Don says,вЂ™you are doing something that is really bad for Bernie!

CNNвЂ™s poor reception last night in Las Vegas when, with over 800,000 people tuning into @FoxNews, Don Lemon asked for the most corrupt politician in television to represent him. I donвЂ™t know Don and have no idea what heвЂ™s got there. I was there 19 nights, & heвЂ™s not even representing his Country anymore!

When Don Lemon said that the Democrat Party is only for the Radical Left, & that the Radical Left

...The U.S. is not responsible for Tariffs being paid to China of 25% on other parts of the world. This is a terrible thing, and the Chinese must stop this now.

Charges brought against Democrat Congressman Michael Wiener, many people in his district, have now been proven in court papers to be false. He knew that he was being called a вЂњdumb copвЂќ and was being spied upon. He should resign his position as the highly partisan Mayor of his own district. He should never have been hired. He was only there to be there.

Our economy is moving so rapidly that we can no longer afford any of the debt that has been soorbitantly accumulated. If we had the policies of the past, weвЂ™d have far greater growth, both now and in the near future!

I am pleased to announce that Andrew McCarthy, President & CEO, @CongressmanMcCarthyNAS, will become my new Communications Director. We are very close, but it is time for McCarthy to put his great EMPIRE power into the positive use of the Federal Government. We are WINNING, and the good news for the American People is that we are doing GREAT!

Thank you for your interest in my race for the United States Supreme Court. My opponent has spent the last two weeks trying to steal the show. She is weak on Crime, the Border, the Military, Vets and 2nd Amendment. He is weak on the Military and is weak on our Second Amendment. He canвЂ™t win in November, but will win in the Great State of Alabama!

I am strongly considering many different solutions to the DACA puzzle - the Wall, Lottery/Reform and Asylum. We need Border Security, Fence & WALL, Military and WALL OPEN. I am 100% ready to secure our Southern Border, especially with our booming economy. We need to have Wall!

The NFL is getting wise to what it sees as unfair competition and corruption. They are correct in thinking that they are losing so much against unfairness that it is almost unfair. I have watched the NFL lose 50% of its games since the league was founded, and they have made it a very unfair sport.

He loves France, he loves the people of France, and he loves the people of France.

Comcast today announced that it will reduce the $151 billion in cost from the very early days of the Internet. This will be a big difference, and a big plus for consumers.

House Republicans will vote on tomorrow night a Bill that will provide certainty on prescription drug prices, keeps our communities from unnecessary and costly prescription drug price hikes, keeps our economy booming, keeps our military from imploding, keeps our borders from crime, keeps our military from dying, and keeps our borders from illegal immigration.

American people are entitled to know the facts. There are many sides to this story, many different types, but the Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, have it RIGGED. The American public is entitled to its REALITY!

We are in the final days of the Great Recession, when we have seen the most economic number in the history of our country, and the economy is strong. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve continues to push us to near zero growth....

ThatвЂ™s why we are winning!

Netanyahu and the State of Israel will always fight for Israel. We have fought for Israel since the beginning of time. We have to get up and fight for our people. We have to do it now. We need to win in 2020!

I have always said this will only be the beginning. Remember, we are a democracy, not a Socialist Dictator.

       The biggest con is that President Obama was not informed about the horrible Iran Deal until he signed. He signed it anyway, and the Radical Left Democrats never saw it coming. So far, Iran has not taken back the terrible deal they broke, and America has been treated much better than before!

It has been reported that the Federal Reserve, at the request of Governor @RudyGiuliani, has cut interest rates and is increasing purchases of Treasuries.Fed at their full potential.

2018 is the 50th Anniversary of the @MAGA Initiative, which started in 1998, and we are at a historic 50-win percent with respect to economic growth. I am confident that our Country will be even better in the decades to come - and that 2018 will be the year of freedom and prosperity!

We cannot allow the Democrats to destroy the Republican Party by stripping away the many rights that it has had for so many years. We must not let them take away the millions of voters that have been loyal to this Party ever since. Must win major victories for Republicans in November.

The Democrats are doing nothing on immigration and security. They only want to raise your taxes, open your borders, and make it harder for you to buy your own food. This is the problem with the Democrats, they donвЂ™t care about Crime or the Border!

The real crime rate in the United States is way down. If the Democrats had the votes, we would have the greatest economy in the world. They donвЂ™t care about Crime or the Border, would only give us BAD Trade Deals, and more bad Trade Deals. They donвЂ™t even care about our GREAT Military or our Vets!

The Democrats have zero understanding of Immigration. They are so focused on dividing the American People that they donвЂ™t even care about the Border. They donвЂ™t even want the Wall, they want a Wall! They want Open Borders, which means Crime, Drugs, and Human Trafficking. We need the Wall!

No matter what the cost, I have earned your trust and will never give up on the desperately needed Southern Border Security - and the Wall, or Wall or Wall! It is on full display in Arlington National Cemetery - you have my full Endorsement!https://secure.winred.com/majesty-gavin-streets/donate �

USA TODAY

The Fake News Media and Democrat Chairs of Congress, many of whom have already served for very long and have very little to no actual money, are flocking to the @RalphNormanRallum Rally tonight in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for his opponent. Ralph N. is weak on Crime, weak on the Border, and bad on the Military. He doesn't have a clue as to the Constitution, or Second Amendment. Vote for Gary! #MAGA

I am thrilled to be in the White House, together with the people of Utah, for a major, and very important, REPUBLICAN PRELIMINARY RALLY. Ralph N. has done a fantastic job representing the people of Utah, and with you being his Administration. He will be a great Senator!

...This was just one of many Fake and Corrupt News stories being told about the Presidential race between two candidates who have been fighting for a single issue for decades. They are all coming in droves, and that will change. So if you want to run, VOTE FOR US! I look forward to campaigning with you!

..Our NationвЂ™s Intelligence Agencies have repeatedly told the Russian Government that the Trump Campaign and Russia-affiliated Russians campaigned on a theme of hatred and hate against the United States and the United States itself.

FAKE NEWS - A total fabrication! Thank you to @nytimes for the correction. My Times, which has gone totally bonkers in trying to cover the major stories, is far more accurate today than it was in the days before the Election. When you have Fake News, like now, you better have the facts!

The Fake News Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is today. Pundits, which have gone BORING for the past 3 years, are now going after me for NOTHING, only to find out that I paid for it, & were very ungrateful to the President & the people. Really dishonest reporting. Fake News will never be safe!

....Today, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overturned a lower court's (our) lower court's (our monetary) decision that the National Security Adviser of the time (and now his wife) had asked for and received anonymous text messages while on foreign soil. ThatвЂ™s all I am, a total phony!

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit took a phony President Trump вЂњвЂќ case and turned it into a campaign slogan. I am far beyond a candidate, nor an opponent. I was just getting started! Since Election Day, the number of people who actually got an

General Motors and General Motors must both give up their phony debate and cowards to get President ObamaвЂ™s auto orders.

Joe loves New Hampshire, he will always vote for @JoeBiden!https://twitter.com/jimmytwitter/status/168488516109526928 вЂ¦

When the anti-Zionist Jewish lobby, led mostly by the so-called hard working people, naively thought that the so-called gains from the Trump Administration would be enough to get them elected, they were sadly right: NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM!

This story of how the United States came to be against Israel, only to be defeated in the Middle East, and then again, the World, for the first time in decades, is called вЂњAmazing Stories.вЂќ True, but the American people love the story. It is so true!

The Obama Administration was the biggest beneficiary of the China Deal - $151 Billion Dollars, $151 Billion In Tariffs. In the meantime, the United Arab Emirates continue to ripoff the United States for decades after the deal was made. The U.S. was made for nothing, and Zero Trade!

The Obama Administrations business is booming, orders & orders. Companies are moving jobs back to the United States after 3 years in business, and $151 Billion Dollars in Tariffs. ThatвЂ™s just the tip of the iceberg. The Chinese вЂњjunkвЂќ

Troy A. Williams, The Wall Street Journal: вЂњThis is about more than the economy can do. This is about the future of the United States.вЂќ
The Wall Street Journal stated that economic numbers are the slowest in more than 18 years.вЂќ ThatвЂ™s because of the Midterms. Deal with Democrats is the future of the economy, not Obstruction. But that is only because of the Republicans. They canвЂ™t win in 2020!
 The Economy is doing well, with record business growth. Companies are pouring back into the United States. The question is whether or not the Democrats will allow growth to continue! In either event, the United States is in better shape than ever before!

Comcast wants to turn the Hiring Page of their now disgraced and failed rival Comcast into a tax haven. That would be so much economic and free publicity for them - and so little benefit to the consumer. So without more Comcast money, they are ducking the tax implications now - and hoping for the worst.

      When will the Democrats admit they are wrong. There has never been a time like these days, except for presidential inaugurations.

It is my opinion that a U.S. Embassy shutdown is not in the interests of the United States, our Great Military or Veterans, or any other group. This is a long time standing policy and it should be ended. I will be fighting for our Country and our Military!

This is the second time in a few days that Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who has done more for the Democrats & done more damage to our Country than any President in our CountryвЂ™s history, has been slammed for her terrible Trade Deals.

The economy is only getting better for the U.S. and our great American workers. With all of the pressure being put on the Fake News Media, whose ratings are now at their lowest since the early 1970s, we are getting even better numbers. People are loving the jobs numbers, which have been going up for years. Thank you!

BACKGROUND:

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has stated that the American public is "highly likely" to have a mental illness. This study aimed to gather together all countries that have published a mental health issue, in order to better inform the public.

OBJECTIVE/STANDARD:

To determine the relationship between smoking and the risk of developing a mental health problem. We sought to determine the risk of developing a mental health problem if the risk of developing a mental health problem was 1.0 (95% CIs), 2.9 (95% CIs), or 3.0 (95% CIs).

ROBJECTIVE/STANDARD:

To determine the relationship between smoking and the risk of developing a mental health problem. We sought to gather together all countries that have published a mental health issue, in order to better inform the public. WEIGHT = 12.4 Billion Dollars, in 2011.

THE PARTY RESULTS:

57% of the people seeking medical help for a medical condition reported that they had it in their blood, in their breath, or in the saliva. These were very common, common, and common conditions, and were caused by a virus or disease. People with a mental illness have a much higher chance of contracting the virus.

GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan - Presidential Harassment has officially been exposed at the highest level, at the highest level of journalistic ethics and journalistic ethics.
The story of the week is the Mueller Report. But there is still much to be said about it, including the many lies and phony stories, that have been out for weeks, and for no reason. So far, so good!
The Do Nothing Democrats are getting little respect, or respect, in the Republican Party. Look at the numbers! The Republicans are getting nothing done despite the phony & disgusting Mueller Report.

I am 100% certain that President Trump is 100% sure that the lawyers at the Southern Border will never be able to properly represent me or the President because there was no Russian Collusion and there was no money involved. I was just forced to fire the FBI Director and all other top FBI guys because there was No Collusion.

Why is it that the only people that know me and my policies are those that have worked so well for them, & the Fake News Media, that have been working so hard to determine whether or not I was correct, & whether or not I was wrong, are at it again!

The Democrats do not want to give the vote to Brett Kavanaugh. They want to protect Sleepy Joe Biden, who has yet to even be sworn in. They want to give it to President Trump, who has already chosen to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Federal Circuit Court. They want to pick somebody else, and now he picks me to be the next Supreme Court Justice!

The only people thatвЂ™ve done anything wrong are the incompetent Democrats, & the Fake News Media, who have worked overtime to destroy Brett Kavanaugh, for nothing, & now the Republicans want to give him a second chance. They have no idea what they are doing. They have no idea what they are doing. He has been through the cold!

We saw again this morning the cowardly attack on innocent and defenseless young Palestinians by the thugs from the @NasrGaza terror group.

It is called the New World Order!https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/113866013090193304 вЂ¦

When Donald Trump was elected President, polls said Hillary Clinton would eventually have a field of about 20 Democrat voters, or a field of about 50 Republican voters...

Google is finally standing by to watch over the millions of people who are losing their jobs and trying to figure out what to do with them. I know Google is doing a great job, but they should be given proper credit for the work they are doing. Google should be given credit!

In the meantime, what does the United States do with ISIS in Syria and Iraq? We have been engaged in a major air campaign, & we have been hit hard in the last two weeks. ISIS is no longer in our country, & the U.S. has not helped them get weapons. We bombed ISIS bases & caravans, captured leaders, & sent them fleeing. We have also killed lots of them. They have been beaten badly, & we do not want them to fight us again!

Joe Biden will never be a Democrat, and he probably wonвЂ™t be able to get elected in 2020. I hope he is happy, but heвЂ™ll never be a Democrat! He is only representing the Democrat Party, which has been destroyed by the Fake & Corrupt News Media for the past 3 years. He is hurting our Country, and we need him badly!

Columbus Crew SC announced today that it will be bringing back Major League Soccer.

It is a disgrace that the Department of Commerce & Justice, with all their bureaucratic hat tricks, are asking Congress to take no action on China, and China must immediately reimburse them. Should have taken China out in the past, now should be no China!

Economy & Tariffs to non-EU Countries are setting record after record, including for first time ever!
 The United States remains No. 1 on Trade, No. 2 on Trade, and No. 3 on Trade with the European Union - two very important trading partners. It is only right that we should be fighting for their protectionism, which they put very hard on our country-and on our tariff cutting!

Joe Biden, the forgotten man, has just been fired from the very successful State Department. He was forced to resign for gross incompetence and cowardice, and now, after spending 10 years in politics, decides to run for President again. Biden was a terrible choice, and now, after spending 10 years in politics, decides to run against me again.

BERLIN (AFP) - Germany has to pay more for its gas, and Europe to take care of the troops, at a time of massive economic loss (Europe doesnвЂ™t have much gas), that have toil for Europe for our country, with no human rights record, says Robert Mueller.
Thank you to @LouieGentry for the nice words, that are very true. We have to put up much better with Europe. I know that America has much better trade deals than these massive countries, and they have to pay MUCH MORE. Very unfair!

It is now reported that the FBI and DOJ were secretly spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, or hours, a year investigating former FBI Director James Comey, at the request of the now disgraced and discredited Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is a total waste of time and taxpayer dollars. We are now starting to see the results of the Mueller Report, and the Mueller Report itself, which I have just finished, is a disaster for the Country!

You have to agree that the DemocratвЂ™s Impeachment Hoax is a Hoax, a Hoax, a Hoax. They canвЂ™t get the votes for the 2020 Election, and they will never be able to win elections again, because the voters didnвЂ™t see the first one, they never saw the second one, & the third one is just an excuse to вЂњshirkвЂќ from the 2020 Election.

The Democrats are doing nothing but Obstructing the 2020 Election with the Impeachment Hoax, a scam being played out in the Impeachment Hoax. The most corrupt and dishonest Congresswomen and their Democrat co-conspiratorsвЂ™ will never win again because the voters never saw the first & third, & the Fourth & Fifth were just an excuse for NOT doing the job at the previous Administration.

There is a reason that the only Democrat House members are the people who have been doing the most to hurt the Republican Party. The reason theyвЂ™re all bad people is that they were all unable to win the Election because the voters didnвЂ™t see the first & third. The voters never

We have no inflation, inflation hurts!

The U.S. Senate should not allow Impeachment Prejudice against the President of the United States. The Articles of Impeachment are based on Impeachment, not on whether or not President Trump Tower (and others) was illegally given campaign money & money from foreign sources.

I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Justice Gorsuch to be on the Court. He will be a tremendous Justice. I canвЂ™t imagine any other nominee like this. WeвЂ™re moving quickly, weвЂ™re building, weвЂ™re on track, and we need Justice Gorsuch on the Court to get there!

....Hopefully, by the end of this year, all of the appointments made by the President of the United States to the Supreme Court will have been confirmed by the Senate, Democrat obstruction, and show how much we are getting done in the Senate than failed President O!

This is a wonderful opportunity for the U.S. Senate to finally do its job, AFTER TWO YEARS OF OBSTRUCTION and a half OF NOTHING, on the great and important issue of Immigration. This will give hope to millions of people who are now in the United States, and to many more, who are now waiting for their turn.

Former FBI Director James Comey said Sunday on @60Minutes that he was wrong and that he would never be the same. He was fired for fraud. He now works for the FBI. When did Fake News Media start calling him wrong?

Comrade @netanyahu of the United States has become an embarrassment to Iran and the world. All of his lies about me become a disaster for Israel.

It is now commonly agreed, by far the greatest con job in the history of American politics, that the Democrats and the Republicans have done nothing on illegal immigration, that they rarely talk about the Border, or the Border, or the Border, or the Border, or the Border, or the Border, or illegal immigration.

Jerry Nadler has made a mockery of the very concept of merit, and the American people know it. He is a despicable politician who has disgraced himself, and will do anything to get back to campaigning again!
Jerry Nadler was right yesterday in defending his disgraced Democrat teacher, Michael Brown, against a lawsuit. Nadler didnвЂ™t even allege that Brown was profiled in any way, shape or form, in order to make him, at least legally, a hero. He just wanted to protect his students, and no one should be afraid.

Cohen has been harassed and mocked all over the world for his dealings in Ukraine, and his father, who has been working so hard for his family, has been scorned all over the world.

It is my honor to nominate Secretary of Labor Andrew Puzder to be the new Secretary of Labor. I have known Andrew for a long time вЂ“ he is a class act and I have no doubt he will be a winner. I have also worked with him on many important fronts. I also know he will be well prepared to do the job вЂ“ it will be a very hard sell. I look forward to working with Andrew!

Colombia: Elusive Drug Cartels are at the Border. Likewise, the United States of America. The Border is very tight, but the Coronavirus is getting worse and worse - and the U.S. is doing nothing to help. Very bad!
   The U.S. should not allow Coronavirus to flourish in its tracks. Too many passengers & companies trying to board. Too many jobs. We will find a solution. Too many people dying. Report the Coronavirus to the Department of Commerce. We will get it fixed fast!

Political Correctness
Doral was right about @marcorubio who is corrupt and out of touch. He is spending his money on ads that donвЂ™t even allege that I have done anything wrong. That would be so ridiculous, and so incorrect. I did nothing wrong with my decision to run for Pres.вЂ™s office. I have done nothing wrong. Thank you to @SteveScalise for the nice compliments on doing the right thing!

I have been very critical of the way the FBI is handling the Terrible (and Fake) Paul Manafort probe. He and his brother were paid by Crooked Hillary for nothing - and now Paul is asking that I exonerate him for his crimes? He should.

Comcast Cable & AT&T are now Comcast executives. They were bosses long before the Obama Administration took over. Remember Comcast took over NBC Universal, NBC/WSJ was not a priority, and Comcast didnвЂ™t want to be part of the Comcast/NBC deal. A very bad situation!

When the NFL does final cuts, the NFL, and so many others, will start to pay their share of the cost. Major players will soon be leaving the league, and much more. The NFL always had a part in this (badly negotiated) mess. I hope the NFL players will continue to WIN, and if not, the NFL players, who make and sell the most meaningless and unfair contracts in the history of our country, will pay!

U.S. Senate, Republicans must work on Borders and finally support Farm Bill. We should finally approve large scale Farm Bill, NOT just Farm Bill.

Comcast (Comcast) has dropped out of the highly respected Energy Star competition. Alex Steyer got in on the act by getting the job, and Comcast did nothing about it. Steyer now keeps trying to get in on the contest for NBC, despite strong NBC management. NBC should drop out of the competition entirely!

Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) of Tennessee has done a terrible job for the people of Tennessee. Big Tax Cuts and Regulation Cuts, Military, Vets, and Second Amendment. Bob is strong on Crime, the Border, and loves our Military and our Vets.

comcast, Comcast will be taking a big step back from the political correctness game that soars over the next two years. The disgrace that their terrible and costly infrastructural reviews have caused them, as a group, has been devastating. I will be the first to let you know if ratings drop again!

What has happened to the Fake News Media in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, should be a lesson to other countries. They knowingly fabricate facts to advance their own political agenda? They act as if stories from other countries, countries and countries donвЂ™t exist, therefore, stories from us, countries and countries should not exist.....

In the meantime, it is being reported that the FBI, like the DOJ, is investigating whether or not Clinton Campaign paid for, and is in the process of receiving, State Department State Department Emails (and others) from a man named Christopher Steele. This is a big problem, and a big time mistake!

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Obama: вЂњIвЂ™m proud of the President for sticking by me at the BorderвЂќ

President Obama was happy that I stayed in the White House вЂ“ easy to do when I have the economy booming, and thatвЂ™s OK because I am a great believer in American Exceptionalism.вЂќ He was a great believer in our great spirit of achievement and American Citizenship. I will always be a great American. IвЂ™ll always be a great American.

The White House CorrespondentsвЂ™ Dinner is now over because the Fake News Media refused to cover it. It was a big loss in ratings and conference room time because of it, but now the real story is the President and the fact that I stayed for the honor of вЂњPresident.вЂќ HeвЂ™s done nothing wrong.

The so-called вЂњMessiah has not died, heвЂ™s revived.вЂќ Within the first hour of my coming to the White House, 3.2 million visitors to the U.S. watched, thousands of jobs created, 250,000 plus jobs, the Economy growing

No, we are not. They didnвЂ™t want to negotiate, they just wanted to take the badly run and ineffective New York Times. So we are doing much better than the Democrats. Really good, and there is much potential for growth. I just think itвЂ™s better to get back to business!

 The Wall is an artificial barrier that will stop cars from passing through it and over it, and only those that meet the Wall standard will be allowed in.

The Special Counsel never even went to the 3 days and 33 witnesses. He was sooo appointed and sooo conflicted, he must have a case, just like the Trump Campaign, that cannot be made up. But what the Special Counsel did was INVESTIGATE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, not the Trump Campaign!

I am doing a big push to end the horrible, and costly, Witch Hunt and all related Collusion with Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia - and now, because of the corrupt and dishonest Do Nothing Democrats and their son, Steele, we have the most Corrupt, Anti-Trump & Anti-Russia Investigation in U.S. history!

The Wall Street Journal has just announced that the Obama Administration had me in their sights for a top job at the Border. We had a very productive and productive meeting at the Border, and that is what the media hates to mention. We had a great time, and now the good news is that we will have a great president!

In the Mid-Term Elections, the Democrats will love to portray that I am always on the Border, always fighting for our Country. Wrong! The Dems are fighting to take us away from the United States, always weak and ineffective, always out of the game! I am on Border for two reasons: (1) Defense, and (2) Border Security.

I was thrilled to be back in Las Vegas, Nevada, last night with @SteveScalise, owner of the now-defunct @GOPatNation, who will be dealing with the Democrats in 2020. SteveвЂ™s strong Conservative views are powerfully inspiring and will make 2020 a very better and more prosperous year for the Republican Party. SteveвЂ™s nuts!

Thank you to @LarrySabato of the @LarrySabato family for your kind words while in Las Vegas last night. Larry, it is great to be with you. The people of Nevada love you and you have made a BIG difference. Larry has done an incredible job

We are at a turning point in American History. The greatest loser of the last several decades is our great great President. He has earned it, and he will always have it. We have made great progress, but it is time to put an end to all of that.

The National Security Crisis at the @NationalStingle is far bigger and more profound than ever thought. At the same time, the Federal Government, with its tight budgets, weak policies and a depleted Military, have done nothing to help. This will change!

President Trump has authorized an emergency disaster declaration to deal with the raging Global Flood. Many thousands of our Country, and so many others, are now forced to flee their homes. Our Country is now in a very critical condition. We must be prepared, prepared - prepare. Our young people, especially the youngest, are being told the truth.вЂќ @LouDobbs

China, which is doing badly, is spending far more on terrorism than we have ever done, and has far more equipment, personnel and money at their disposal. The State Department, headed up by Secretary Anthony Graziano, is doing a GREAT job. There is no.......

We are doing badly, by far, with terrorism, Afghanistan and many other matters. There was never a time like this in U.S. history, and there may not be another, but we are doing so well (much) militarily and politically. There is nothing to hide, and there is nothing to be

Social Media is working hard at the expense of Fake News, just like they have for years. But the American public, in the form of their favorite author, @PeteHegseth, is getting wise to the tremendous dishonesty & corruption going on behind the scenes at the @SocialMedia

Life is so hard for so many people. We have so much to lose, and so little to gain. We must always save America, and our country. We canвЂ™t let people take advantage of us on trade or anything else!

President Trump and the Republican Party are working hard to get rid of the loopholes that keep our Country from being built properly. Make sure that we donвЂ™t have to spend more on lawyers than we save on labor!

Consumer Confidence and Jobs
Consumer Confidence and Jobs in August were the highest in U.S. history. Companies had to work overtime to get our economy moving again. Companies are investing big dollars in the U.S.A. again, a big plus!

The Washington Post was a bad ratings mongering paper for 8 years. They were actually bad for me! They are now worse! When I won the 2016 Presidential Election, they were all negative, & now they are just BAD. DonвЂ™t worry, the good people of the United States are happy!

Comcast is a total joke. вЂњShiftyвЂќ Zuckerburg is a total mess who doesnвЂ™t have a clue as to why he is doing this terrible and highly unpopular job. Maybe heвЂ™ll help NBC with the big Election hit they are going to have to live with for a while. I am sure he will be a wonderful President of NBC!

The United States will not rest until we find out what happened to the wonderful families and friends who lost their lives in the attack in London. We will find out what happened to those who made this possible. We must come to a loving and enduring alliance with the people of Iraq.

Comcast is doing terrible ratings, and the badly needed Consumer Confidence, which NBC failed to for many years.

I was there and the crowd was crazy. I donвЂ™t care who it was (the dumbest crowd IвЂ™ve ever witnessed), itвЂ™s about the Economy and the desperately needed 7.8% Unemployment Rate.

BACKGROUND & MISSION

We are in the final stages of a major project to renovate and modernize our very outdated Military, one that has long been broken down and broken down even further. With that being said, we have done a great job of rebuilding our Military and bringing it even closer to being one for the American people!

Our Military is one step closer to fully rebuilding after many years of losing it to other countries & the United States, for unlimited future use. We have done much to rebuild and modernize it. We have saved many lives, & we have done it again under the Trump Administration!https://www.pscp.tv/w/bxqpsDFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MXlwSmTkRWNbEe5W4Eg4uXS4d_XQ-imQ-fqL3Z2-bG-P?t=1s вЂ¦

We are in the final stages of a major renovation of the badly broken and dilapidated Military at the Southern Border, and it is getting a major renovation that will take care of the new and better Military. We have saved many lives in the process, & the U.S.A. will always be there for those that need it!https://

Opinion: Democrats must make our Country pay for вЂњInsuranceвЂќ!
 Democrats are not supposed to be putting forth the kind of legislation they are doing because they donвЂ™t know what they are doing is вЂњnecessaryвЂќ, and because they are afraid to show their strong, decisive and powerful hand when talking about illegal immigration. This is a big deal, & the Dems forgot to show their hand!

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Times reported that Mr Cameron was in London at the time of the Manchester attack. I was in London and there was not a single mention of the Manchester tragedy!

The US President needs to get the economy booming again, both at the State & Local Level, and European Union countries must likewise get strong immigration policies. I hope our Country will be able to do without these people, or any future migrants, for a very long time.

I was about to go to Helsinki, Finland, and meet with the President of Ukraine, who is a very special man, but when I came to his country, he was smiling and acting a little bit surprised. I told him how great it is to be in his country, and he did exactly what I said, including opening our borders, for future migrants. Wow!

The Mayor of Helsinki, who is a total phony, was talking of his decision not to fire his wonderful mayor, who is doing a terrible job, while still giving big financial bonuses to a couple of hundred people. Very dishonest and bad Mayor who was only there to say I am leaving his city for another place, not another location!

Thank you to @JudgeJeanine Pirro for the nice words and insight she has given to the @nytimes. She is a great reporter and person, but she is really bad at what she is doing.

It is a total disgrace that, after so many years, the Democrats are still trying to use the Impeachment Hoax as a way to save face for 2020.

Not only was the World not taking into account the many human and environmental impacts, it was not respecting our historic pledges...

News stories about me going broke and not being able to properly run a successful business are totally false. I am doing very well and moving forward! I have done far more in the business of running a successful business than any other President in U.S. history.

There is a great deal to be gained from a truly massive Tax Cut & Tax Reform, including a much needed National Guard. But the real gain comes from knowing and appreciating the people who make and produce here in the Great State of Wisconsin!

BETWEEN two dozen Senate Democrats and one of them knows me well (he doesnвЂ™t have to), heвЂ™s saying that I am going to win the Midterms anyway, so he can continue to push the вЂњgun control agendaвЂќ of his friend Nancy Pelosi. Well, IвЂ™ll just concede that вЂњthis is a good year,вЂќ and heвЂ™s going to win.

...having a good laugh at the stupidity of the U.S.A. and all of the other countries that have imposed Tariffs on the United States. Only Europe can do that! Europe must take back their currency and monetary policies, and the U.S.A. will become much more like the USA!
...the massive Tax Cuts, especially for the rich and corporations, have made it much easier for them to do business with the United States. When you add it all up, it makes it MUCH easier, for the companies to do business with us, and the companies know it...
In the meantime, the Fake News in the U.S.A. and the Democrat Party in Congress are going CRAZY! They are going after the very smart (and me) people, and the wonderful people of Mississippi for not being able to protect their very vulnerable ObamaCare premiums. That ObamaCare is now dead....

The United States will impose great sanctions against Iran in order to bring it back to the level of the World Championship Football Tournament the USA wonвЂ™t play in.

This was the first time in more than two decades that the President of the United States, and not the Democrat (or Crooked) agenda, had a problem with a Democrat. I was in the White House at the time, and the Democrat problem was the fact that they wanted to do very little for us. We were only spending a small fraction of what they were spending on military protection - and we didnвЂ™t have to give up.

™ЂњYou know whatвЂ™s the worst is not knowing who is going to win.вЂ™вЂќ @seanhannity, @FoxNews and @seanhdraccallum are two friends who are STILL pushing the Democrat Party вЂ“ they want more people to Crime!
 The Democrats have put Criminal Justice Reform on hold because of the tremendous success of the Mueller Report. Their вЂњleadersвЂќ include Nancy Pelosi, Chris Stewart, Adam Schiff, Chris Van Hollen, Adam Schiff, Chris Van Hollen, Adam Schiff, Adam Schiff, Adam Schiff, and now the now 17 Angry Democrats, @WSJ, @LouDobbs and @AlanDersh.

There is no reason to live in a China based economy as bad as China based. They will all come, but China based manufacturers will be hurt. China is self indulgent and will never buy your product. They made a big mistake, and we have to live with it!

More and more states are asking how much power and money the Federal Reserve has. It is very hard to protect your precious money. Not only is it very expensive, it is not FUNDING. Not only is it VERY UNFAIR, it is also VERY UNPROFIT. ThatвЂ™s why they are so important. They insure your money VERY well, and then when the market doesnвЂ™t work, they add.....

So bad for our Country!

Alan Dershowitz and the Democrats are going CRAZY. They donвЂ™t want to fix the loopholes - they just want to fix loopholes вЂ“ and loopholes that have no reasonable explanation. No, they want to fix the loopholes and loopholes of our Country. They have zero respect for the rule of law, or for our Constitution.вЂќ @LouDobbs

In addition, the USA has to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year more to foreign countries, and they must end their ridiculous and unfair Trade Deals, Trade Barriers and Barriers to come into play.

Comey was working for a Democrat who was trying to protect Crooked Hillary Clinton and her lover, the Mob. He was happily married to a beautiful Ukrainian beauty and had just one of his many children. He was just disrespected, even by the Democrats! The Obama Gang of Vultures are now turning against the United States, and against our great First Lady, Melania!
