The worldвЂ™s population is expected to grow by 3% per year for the next two centuries. But those who live near where the disease was once thought to be will live longer than ever before. Here's what life is like 200 million years ago: https://b-gat.es/2MWhCa pic.twitter.com/4TSI8Y9qfH

IвЂ™m often asked how we could ensure that all the people who would otherwise be paralyzed by polio donвЂ™t live longer than ever. One in five people living with polio are stillborn. ThatвЂ™s why we're launching this effort to gather more data about how long it will take to learn what polio is doing to babies.

The world needs to know more about how much blood it takes to learn how to code. HereвЂ™s how weвЂ™re mapping how many new infections each month. If you have a new or suspected case of polio, I encourage you to come forward and tell my story so the world can keep

GatesвЂ™s plan to halve the number of people who die from AIDS by 2020 is a disaster's game, but itвЂ™s not. I believe we can reduce the number of people who die by preventing the spread of AIDS.

It's important, then, that we use all of our resources to find new ways to slow the spread of AIDS. As Melinda explains in my new #BestFriendsLetter, fighting AIDS is about more than finding the cure. ItвЂ™s about finding a better way to give back.

When you have the best available scientific evidence, you can make a really big difference for the world. And when scientists working on climate change and other climate issues have the chance to impact lives far longer than ever before, it's scientists who get hurt the most.

When scientists share their findings with the world, the consequences can be tremendous. Here are four examples: https://b-gat.es/2WvUoi3 pic.twitter.com/iY7QaXmZWFZ

When a doctor or surgeon tries to save a life, they want their patients to feel as if they have it. This is exactly the case with Shelby Long, who was struck by a car while driving northbound on I-95 around the time she was diagnosed. (ItвЂ™s also why she was so fascinated by science.)https://b-gat.es/2Wvx9XY

When doctors see a patient with severe dementia who isnвЂ™t progressing at a rapid enough rate to be diagnosed with the disease, it can be hard to imagine what it is. ThatвЂ™s precisely why our foundation is partnering with the Center for Biological Diversity to find a more personalized approach to treatment.https://b-gat.es/2Wn8TaO

Paul Allen is one of my favorite authors, so when I asked him to share his latest book, The Purpose of Life, IвЂ™m thrilled to pick up a copy. The 32-year-old philanthropist is co-founder and CEO of The Purpose of Life, a website that helps poor people share their purpose-driven lives.

Trevornoah hopes his new book, which explores his unorthodox approach to writing about HIV, will help other people with HIV gain insight into the disease. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)

IвЂ™m hopeful that readers of all ages will take TrevorвЂ™s leadership as the new face of the #ChangeHIV campaign. IвЂ™m optimistic that his book will help other people who are facing the disease and dying will benefit from the experience.https://twitter.com/TheChangeHIV/status/11lSQU5TVI

The fact that hundreds of millions of people with HIV are still not convinced they can get it, especially when it comes to injecting themselves, is a tragedy. It also shows how much more we care about our ability to treat patients who are already there. Thank you, @MelindaGates and @NIHDirector for your ongoing leadership on this critical issue.https://twitter.com/JeffSuh/status/11lSQHv8c


We need more data showing that progress is possible despite tough times and optimistic signs. As @LuiszaZembla writes in his new book, The Vital Question, we canвЂ™t continue to let the crisis worsen. The more we know about it, the better we can help

Tonight is the premiere of The #FoodShark Act, a remarkable global leadership role that we are launching today as part of our foundation's commitment to fighting hunger and poverty.
Tonight marks one of the deadliest days in human history. We ask people to join us in supporting the work of heroes like Maria Kolinda and the worldвЂ™s poorest woman. Her story is a vivid reminder of why we must all rally around the #FoodSharkAct, and how we can do it again soon.https://b-gat.es/2n5xhXt

Tomorrow is #WorldAIDDay. If youвЂ™re a global health hero like me, I hope youвЂ™ll join me in calling for a world without the use of force. IвЂ™m inspired by the bravery of the leaders who are stepping up to challenge the status quo.
Tonight, I launched the @IHME_UW team вЂ“ a massive team of thinkers, activists, and thinkers who are already doing just that. @Alwaleed_Talal is on the frontline of changeвЂ”fighting against the status quo вЂ”for the world will be safer and healthier once the fight against AIDS is over.

Bund, a German newspaper, recently reported that HIV patients in Mozambique are five times as likely to be diagnosed with HIV as are the general population.

IвЂ™m optimistic that our foundationвЂ™s work will help strengthen the lives of those who struggle to get by. Thanks to our partners, Mozambique has reduced its incidence by more than half in less than two years.https://b-gat.es/2HViY4z

IвЂ™m hopeful that our foundationвЂ™s work in Mozambique will help increase the life expectancy of families in need. More treatment tools will make it easier for people to get treatment and get it back. Ending AIDS is easier than cracking the case.https://b-gat.es/31Xd4Ej

MOSCOW (AP) — President Moshe Felyad announced Friday that he has reached an agreement to end polio for good.

The agreement, reached with a team of brilliant scientists and engineers, establishes an ambitious goal of eradicating polio forever: http://b-gat.es/1PZo8l0 pic.twitter.com/hFdYjxF8jE

The agreement establishes an ambitious goal of eradicating polio forever: $1B will be raised from every $10 raised through @TheGFF. This is a very important milestone, and we will double that amount once the global banking system is fully operational.pic.twitter.com/uAxg4R6cEk

The world has never been better, but polio continues to decline. The GPEF provides crucial funding for early steps toward a polio-free world. It also provides important tools for the international community to fight the disease for good. #WorldPolioDaypic.twitter.com/fK8pWIu2z

When Moshe Felyad met Dr. Yergin Igin in 1988, he was one of the defining members of his circle. Together, they had created a remarkable organization that continues to inspire us today. Together, they have made a lasting impact on our lives. #WorldPolio

As @melindagates writes in @CNN, that means making a difference "for the world."https://b-gat.es/2LfhLi6
